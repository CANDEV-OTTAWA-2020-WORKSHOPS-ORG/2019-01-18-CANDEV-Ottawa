    <title>Gene Shaving using influence function of a kernel method</title>
    <summary>  Identifying significant subsets of the genes, gene shaving is an essential
and challenging issue for biomedical research for a huge number of genes and
the complex nature of biological networks,. Since positive definite kernel
based methods on genomic information can improve the prediction of diseases, in
this paper we proposed a new method, "kernel gene shaving (kernel canonical
correlation analysis (kernel CCA) based gene shaving). This problem is
addressed using the influence function of the kernel CCA. To investigate the
performance of the proposed method in a comparison of three popular gene
selection methods (T-test, SAM and LIMMA), we were used extensive simulated and
real microarray gene expression datasets. The performance measures AUC was
computed for each of the methods. The achievement of the proposed method has
improved than the three well-known gene selection methods. In real data
analysis, the proposed method identified a subsets of $210$ genes out of $2000$
genes. The network of these genes has significantly more interactions than
expected, which indicates that they may function in a concerted effort on colon
cancer.

    <title>RASSA: Resistive Accelerator for Approximate Long Read DNA Mapping</title>
    <summary>  DNA read mapping is a computationally expensive bioinformatics task, required
for genome assembly and consensus polishing. It finds the best-fitting location
for each DNA read on a long reference sequence. A novel resistive approximate
similarity search accelerator, RASSA, exploits charge distribution and parallel
in-memory processing to reflect a mismatch count between DNA sequences. RASSA
implementation of long read DNA mapping outperforms a state-of-art mapping
solution (minimap2) by 16-77x with comparable accuracy.

    <title>Pharmacogenomics in the Age of GWAS, Omics Atlases, and PheWAS</title>
    <summary>  The search for causative pharmacogenomic loci is being transformed by
integrative omics pipelines, but their outputs have only begun being applied to
test design. We assess the direction of the field in light of Biobanks/PheWAS,
omics atlases, and AI. We first assess the potential of recent epigenome and
spatial genome concepts, datasets, and methods to improve the functionality of
PIP-style pipelines. We then discuss new potential methods of genetic test
design on the basis of the outputs of such pipelines. We conclude with a vision
for a pharmacophenomic atlas, in which omics atlas data, PheWAS associations,
and biobank data would be used with AI to design thousands of genetic tests for
clinical deployment in an automated parallel process.

    <title>Analysis of Extremely Obese Individuals Using Deep Learning Stacked
  Autoencoders and Genome-Wide Genetic Data</title>
    <summary>  The aetiology of polygenic obesity is multifactorial, which indicates that
life-style and environmental factors may influence multiples genes to aggravate
this disorder. Several low-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been associated with BMI. However, identified loci only explain a small
proportion of the variation ob-served for this phenotype. The linear nature of
genome wide association studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between
genetic variants and the phenotype have had limited success in explaining the
heritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity in
classification studies. GWAS ignores the epistatic interactions that less
significant variants have on the phenotypic outcome. In this paper we utilise a
novel deep learning-based methodology to reduce the high dimensional space in
GWAS and find epistatic interactions between SNPs for classification purposes.
SNPs were filtered based on the effects associations have with BMI. Since
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing is highly conservative, an important
proportion of SNPs involved in SNP-SNP interactions are ignored. Therefore,
only SNPs with p-values &lt; 1x10-2 were considered for subsequent epistasis
analysis using stacked auto encoders (SAE). This allows the nonlinearity
present in SNP-SNP interactions to be discovered through progressively smaller
hidden layer units and to initialise a multi-layer feedforward artificial
neural network (ANN) classifier. The classifier is fine-tuned to classify
extremely obese and non-obese individuals. The best results were obtained with
2000 compressed units (SE=0.949153, SP=0.933014, Gini=0.949936,
Lo-gloss=0.1956, AUC=0.97497 and MSE=0.054057). Using 50 compressed units it
was possible to achieve (SE=0.785311, SP=0.799043, Gini=0.703566,
Logloss=0.476864, AUC=0.85178 and MSE=0.156315).

    <title>Deep Learning Classification of Polygenic Obesity using Genome Wide
  Association Study SNPs</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, association results from genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) are combined with a deep learning framework to test the predictive
capacity of statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)
associated with obesity phenotype. Our approach demonstrates the potential of
deep learning as a powerful framework for GWAS analysis that can capture
information about SNPs and the important interactions between them. Basic
statistical methods and techniques for the analysis of genetic SNP data from
population-based genome-wide studies have been considered. Statistical
association testing between individual SNPs and obesity was conducted under an
additive model using logistic regression. Four subsets of loci after
quality-control (QC) and association analysis were selected: P-values lower
than 1x10-5 (5 SNPs), 1x10-4 (32 SNPs), 1x10-3 (248 SNPs) and 1x10-2 (2465
SNPs). A deep learning classifier is initialised using these sets of SNPs and
fine-tuned to classify obese and non-obese observations. Using a deep learning
classifier model and genetic variants with P-value &lt; 1x10-2 (2465 SNPs) it was
possible to obtain results (SE=0.9604, SP=0.9712, Gini=0.9817, LogLoss=0.1150,
AUC=0.9908 and MSE=0.0300). As the P-value increased, an evident deterioration
in performance was observed. Results demonstrate that single SNP analysis fails
to capture the cumulative effect of less significant variants and their overall
contribution to the outcome in disease prediction, which is captured using a
deep learning framework.

    <title>SSCU: an R/Bioconductor package for analyzing selective profile in
  synonymous codon usage</title>
    <summary>  Background Synonymous codon choice is mainly affected by mutation and
selection. For the majority of genes within a genome, mutational pressure is
the major driving force, but selective strength can be strong and dominant for
specific set of genes or codons. More specifically, the selective strength on
translational efficiency and accuracy increases with the gene's expression
level. Many statistical approaches have been developed to evaluate and quantify
the selective profile in codon usage, including S index and Akashi's test, but
no program or pipeline has been developed that includes these tests and
automates the calculation.
  Results In this study, we release an R package SSCU (selective strength for
codon usage, v2.4.0), which includes tools for codon usage analyses. The
package identifies optimal codons using two approaches (comparative and
correlative methods), implements well-established statistics for detecting
codon selection, such as S index, Akashi's test, and estimates standard genomic
statistics, such as genomic GC3, RSCU and Nc.
  Conclusions The package is useful for researchers working on the codon usage
analysis, and thus has general interest to the biological research community.
The package is deposited and curated at the Bioconductor site, and has
currently been downloaded for more than 2000 times and ranked as top 50%
packages.

    <title>Quantitative and functional post-translational modification proteomics
  reveals that TREPH1 plays a role in plant thigmomorphogenesis</title>
    <summary>  Plants can sense both intracellular and extracellular mechanical forces and
can respond through morphological changes. The signaling components responsible
for mechanotransduction of the touch response are largely unknown. Here, we
performed a high-throughput SILIA (stable isotope labeling in
Arabidopsis)-based quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis to profile changes
in protein phosphorylation resulting from 40 seconds of force stimulation in
Arabidopsis thaliana. Of the 24 touch-responsive phosphopeptides identified,
many were derived from kinases, phosphatases, cytoskeleton proteins, membrane
proteins and ion transporters. TOUCH-REGULATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN1 (TREPH1) and MAP
KINASE KINASE 2 (MKK2) and/or MKK1 became rapidly phosphorylated in
touch-stimulated plants. Both TREPH1 and MKK2 are required for touch-induced
delayed flowering, a major component of thigmomorphogenesis. The treph1-1 and
mkk2 mutants also exhibited defects in touch-inducible gene expression. A
non-phosphorylatable site-specific isoform of TREPH1 (S625A) failed to restore
touch-induced flowering delay of treph1-1, indicating the necessity of S625 for
TREPH1 function and providing evidence consistent with the possible functional
relevance of the touch-regulated TREPH1 phosphorylation. Bioinformatic analysis
and biochemical subcellular fractionation of TREPH1 protein indicate that it is
a soluble protein. Altogether, these findings identify new protein players in
Arabidopsis thigmomorphogenesis regulation, suggesting that protein
phosphorylation may play a critical role in plant force responses.

    <title>Genome-Wide Association Studies: Information Theoretic Limits of
  Reliable Learning</title>
    <summary>  In the problems of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), the objective is to
associate subsequences of individuals' genomes to the observable
characteristics called phenotypes. The genome containing the biological
information of an individual can be represented by a sequence of length $G$.
Many observable characteristics of individuals can be related to a subsequence
of a given length $L$ called causal subsequence. The environmental affects make
the relation between the causal subsequence and the observable characteristics
a stochastic function. Our objective in this paper is to detect the causal
subsequence of a specific phenotype using a dataset of $N$ individuals and
their observed characteristics. We introduce an abstract formulation of GWAS
which allows us to investigate the problem from an information theoretic
perspective. In particular, as the parameters $N,G,$ and $L$ grow, we observe a
threshold effect at $\frac{Gh(L/G)}{N}$, where $h(.)$ is the binary entropy
function. This effect allows us to define the capacity of recovering the causal
subsequence by denoting the rate of the GWAS problem as $\frac{Gh(L/G)}{N}$. We
develop an achievable scheme and a matching converse for this problem, and thus
characterize its capacity in two scenarios: the zero-error-rate and the
$\epsilon-$error-rate.

    <title>Fast computation of the principal components of genotype matrices in
  Julia</title>
    <summary>  Finding the largest few principal components of a matrix of genetic data is a
common task in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), both for dimensionality
reduction and for identifying unwanted factors of variation. We describe a
simple random matrix model for matrices that arise in GWASs, showing that the
singular values have a bulk behavior that obeys a Marchenko-Pastur distributed
with a handful of large outliers. We also implement Golub-Kahan-Lanczos (GKL)
bidiagonalization in the Julia programming language, providing thick restarting
and a choice between full and partial reorthogonalization strategies to control
numerical roundoff. Our implementation of GKL bidiagonalization is up to 36
times faster than software tools used commonly in genomics data analysis for
computing principal components, such as EIGENSOFT and FlashPCA, which use dense
LAPACK routines and randomized subspace iteration respectively.

    <title>Deep Neural Network for Analysis of DNA Methylation Data</title>
    <summary>  Many researches demonstrated that the DNA methylation, which occurs in the
context of a CpG, has strong correlation with diseases, including cancer. There
is a strong interest in analyzing the DNA methylation data to find how to
distinguish different subtypes of the tumor. However, the conventional
statistical methods are not suitable for analyzing the highly dimensional DNA
methylation data with bounded support. In order to explicitly capture the
properties of the data, we design a deep neural network, which composes of

dimensional deep features of the DNA methylation data. Experiments show these
features perform best in breast cancer DNA methylation data cluster analysis,

    <title>Mass-spectrometry of single mammalian cells quantifies proteome
  heterogeneity during cell differentiation</title>
    <summary>  Cellular heterogeneity is important to biological processes, including cancer
and development. However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because
of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single
cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by
Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct
human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify
over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer
protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and
transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many
genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the
mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification,
especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring
proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional
phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.

    <title>Fast Characterization of Segmental Duplications in Genome Assemblies</title>
    <summary>  Segmental duplications (SDs), or low-copy repeats (LCR), are segments of DNA
greater than 1 Kbp with high sequence identity that are copied to other regions
of the genome. SDs are among the most important sources of evolution, a common
cause of genomic structural variation, and several are associated with diseases
of genomic origin. Despite their functional importance, SDs present one of the
major hurdles for de novo genome assembly due to the ambiguity they cause in
building and traversing both state-of-the-art overlap-layout-consensus and de
Bruijn graphs. This causes SD regions to be misassembled, collapsed into a
unique representation, or completely missing from assembled reference genomes
for various organisms. In turn, this missing or incorrect information limits
our ability to fully understand the evolution and the architecture of the
genomes. Despite the essential need to accurately characterize SDs in
assemblies, there is only one tool that has been developed for this purpose,
called Whole Genome Assembly Comparison (WGAC). WGAC is comprised of several
steps that employ different tools and custom scripts, which makes it difficult
and time consuming to use. Thus there is still a need for algorithms to
characterize within-assembly SDs quickly, accurately, and in a user friendly
manner.
  Here we introduce a SEgmental Duplication Evaluation Framework (SEDEF) to
rapidly detect SDs through sophisticated filtering strategies based on Jaccard
similarity and local chaining. We show that SEDEF accurately detects SDs while
maintaining substantial speed up over WGAC that translates into practical run
times of minutes instead of weeks. Notably, our algorithm captures up to 25%
pairwise error between segments, where previous studies focused on only 10%,
allowing us to more deeply track the evolutionary history of the genome.
  SEDEF is available at https://github.com/vpc-ccg/sedef

    <title>RPM-Drive: A robust, safe, and reversible gene drive system that remains
  functional after 200+ generations</title>
    <summary>  Despite the advent of several novel, synthetic gene drive mechanisms and
their potential to one-day control a number of devastating diseases, among
other applications, practical use of these systems remains contentious and
risky. In particular, there is little in the way of empirical evidence of the
long-term robustness of these synthetic systems against mutational breakdown.
Rather, most existing systems are either known or predicted to be susceptible
to rapid inactivation, though methodological designs continue to be refined.
Here we evaluate a currently existing synthetic, underdominance-based gene
drive system 200+ generations after it was first established in a laboratory
colony of Drosophila melanogaster. Not only do we find that the system is still
functioning as designed, we also show evidence that disruptions to the genetic
construct are highly likely to be removed by natural selection, contributing to
the system's robust, long-term stability. This stability appears to be a result
of a fundamental relationship between ribosomal proteins (a novel target of the
system) and natural cellular defenses that protect against cancer development.
As far as we are aware, this is the longest continually functioning synthetic
gene drive system thus verified, making it highly appropriate for additional
research into its eventual suitability for field trials. Due to inherent
properties of this gene drive, it is also likely to be adaptable for use in
many different species. The insect lines established and used to test this
system have been deposited at a Drosophila stock center, and are available to
labs for further, independent testing.

    <title>Insights into Complex Brain Functions Related to Schizophrenia Disorder
  through Causal Network Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Gene expression represents a fundamental interface between genes and
environment in the development and ongoing plasticity of the human organism.
Individual differences in gene expression are likely to underpin much of human
diversity, including psychiatric illness. Gene expression shows distinct
regularity pattern in different tissues. Therefore, brain tissue analysis
provides insights into brain disorder mechanisms. Furthermore, mechanistic
understanding of gene regularity pattern can be provided through studying the
underlying relationships as a complex network. Identification of brain specific
gene relationships provides a complementary framework in which to tackle the
complex dysregulations that occur in neuropsychiatric and other neurological
disorders. Using a systems approach established in Mendelian randomization and
Bayesian Network, we integrated genetic and transcriptomic data from
common-mind consortium and identified transcriptomic causal networks in
observational studies. Focusing on Schizophrenia disorder, we identified high
impact genes and revealed their underlying pathways in brain tissue. In
addition, we generated novel hypotheses including genes as causes of the
Schizophrenia associated genes and new genes associated with Schizophrenia.
This approach may facilitate a better understanding of the disease mechanism
that is complementary to molecular experimental studies especially for complex
systems and large-scale data sets.

    <title>EBIC: an evolutionary-based parallel biclustering algorithm for pattern
  discover</title>
    <summary>  In this paper a novel biclustering algorithm based on artificial intelligence
(AI) is introduced. The method called EBIC aims to detect biologically
meaningful, order-preserving patterns in complex data. The proposed algorithm
is probably the first one capable of discovering with accuracy exceeding 50%
multiple complex patterns in real gene expression datasets. It is also one of
the very few biclustering methods designed for parallel environments with
multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). We demonstrate that EBIC outperforms
state-of-the-art biclustering methods, in terms of recovery and relevance, on
both synthetic and genetic datasets. EBIC also yields results over 12 times
faster than the most accurate reference algorithms. The proposed algorithm is
anticipated to be added to the repertoire of unsupervised machine learning
algorithms for the analysis of datasets, including those from large-scale
genomic studies.

    <title>EBIC: an open source software for high-dimensional and big data
  biclustering analyses</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: In this paper we present the latest release of EBIC, a
next-generation biclustering algorithm for mining genetic data. The major
contribution of this paper is adding support for big data, making it possible
to efficiently run large genomic data mining analyses. Additional enhancements
include integration with R and Bioconductor and an option to remove influence
of missing value on the final result.
  Results: EBIC was applied to datasets of different sizes, including a large
DNA methylation dataset with 436,444 rows. For the largest dataset we observed
over 6.6 fold speedup in computation time on a cluster of 8 GPUs compared to
running the method on a single GPU. This proves high scalability of the
algorithm.
  Availability: The latest version of EBIC could be downloaded from
http://github.com/EpistasisLab/ebic . Installation and usage instructions are
also available online.

    <title>Convolutional Neural Networks In Classifying Cancer Through DNA
  Methylation</title>
    <summary>  DNA Methylation has been the most extensively studied epigenetic mark.
Usually a change in the genotype, DNA sequence, leads to a change in the
phenotype, observable characteristics of the individual. But DNA methylation,
which happens in the context of CpG (cytosine and guanine bases linked by
phosphate backbone) dinucleotides, does not lead to a change in the original
DNA sequence but has the potential to change the phenotype. DNA methylation is
implicated in various biological processes and diseases including cancer. Hence
there is a strong interest in understanding the DNA methylation patterns across
various epigenetic related ailments in order to distinguish and diagnose the
type of disease in its early stages. In this work, the relationship between
methylated versus unmethylated CpG regions and cancer types is explored using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A CNN based Deep Learning model that can
classify the cancer of a new DNA methylation profile based on the learning from
publicly available DNA methylation datasets is then proposed.

    <title>Detecting T-cell receptors involved in immune responses from single
  repertoire snapshots</title>
    <summary>  Hypervariable T-cell receptors (TCR) play a key role in adaptive immunity,
recognising a vast diversity of pathogen-derived antigens. High throughput
sequencing of TCR repertoires (RepSeq) produces huge datasets of T-cell
receptor sequences from blood and tissue samples. However, our ability to
extract clinically relevant information from RepSeq data is limited, mainly
because little is known about TCR-disease associations. Here we present a
statistical approach called ALICE (Antigen-specific Lymphocyte Identification
by Clustering of Expanded sequences) that identifies TCR sequences that are
actively involved in the current immune response from a single RepSeq sample,
and apply it to repertoires of patients with a variety of disorders -
autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis), patients under cancer
immunotherapy, or subject to an acute infection (live yellow fever vaccine).
The method's robustness is demonstrated by the agreement of its predictions
with independent assays, and is supported by its ability to selectively detect
responding TCR in the memory but not in the naive subset. ALICE requires no
longitudinal data collection nor large cohorts, and is thus directly applicable
to most RepSeq datasets. Its results facilitate the identification of TCR
variants associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions, which can
be used for diagnostics, rational vaccine design and evaluation of the adaptive
immune system state.

    <title>Reconstructing Latent Orderings by Spectral Clustering</title>
    <summary>  Spectral clustering uses a graph Laplacian spectral embedding to enhance the
cluster structure of some data sets. When the embedding is one dimensional, it
can be used to sort the items (spectral ordering). A number of empirical
results also suggests that a multidimensional Laplacian embedding enhances the
latent ordering of the data, if any. This also extends to circular orderings, a
case where unidimensional embeddings fail. We tackle the task of retrieving
linear and circular orderings in a unifying framework, and show how a latent
ordering on the data translates into a filamentary structure on the Laplacian
embedding. We propose a method to recover it, illustrated with numerical
experiments on synthetic data and real DNA sequencing data. The code and
experiments are available at https://github.com/antrec/mdso.

    <title>Drug response prediction by ensemble learning and drug-induced gene
  expression signatures</title>
    <summary>  Chemotherapeutic response of cancer cells to a given compound is one of the
most fundamental information one requires to design anti-cancer drugs. Recent
advances in producing large drug screens against cancer cell lines provided an
opportunity to apply machine learning methods for this purpose. In addition to
cytotoxicity databases, considerable amount of drug-induced gene expression
data has also become publicly available. Following this, several methods that
exploit omics data were proposed to predict drug activity on cancer cells.
However, due to the complexity of cancer drug mechanisms, none of the existing
methods are perfect. One possible direction, therefore, is to combine the
strengths of both the methods and the databases for improved performance. We
demonstrate that integrating a large number of predictions by the proposed
method improves the performance for this task. The predictors in the ensemble
differ in several aspects such as the method itself, the number of tasks method
considers (multi-task vs. single-task) and the subset of data considered
(sub-sampling). We show that all these different aspects contribute to the
success of the final ensemble. In addition, we attempt to use the drug screen
data together with two novel signatures produced from the drug-induced gene
expression profiles of cancer cell lines. Finally, we evaluate the method
predictions by in vitro experiments in addition to the tests on data sets.The
predictions of the methods, the signatures and the software are available from
\url{http://mtan.etu.edu.tr/drug-response-prediction/}.

    <title>OLGA: fast computation of generation probabilities of B- and T-cell
  receptor amino acid sequences and motifs</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: High-throughput sequencing of large immune repertoires has
enabled the de- velopment of methods to predict the probability of generation
by V(D)J recombination of T- and B-cell receptors of any specific nucleotide
sequence. These generation probabilities are very non-homogeneous, ranging over
20 orders of magnitude in real repertoires. Since the function of a receptor
really depends on its protein sequence, it is important to be able to predict
this probability of generation at the amino acid level. However, brute-force
summation over all the nucleotide sequences with the correct amino acid
translation is computationally intractable. The purpose of this paper is to
present a solution to this problem.
  Results: We use dynamic programming to construct an efficient and flexible
algorithm, called OLGA (Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin
Amino-acid sequences), for calculating the probability of generating a given
CDR3 amino acid sequence or motif, with or without V/J restriction, as a result
of V(D)J recombination in B or T cells. We apply it to databases of
epitope-specific T-cell receptors to evaluate the probability that a typical
human subject will possess T cells responsive to specific disease-associated
epitopes. The model prediction shows an excellent agreement with published
data. We suggest that OLGA may be a useful tool to guide vaccine design.

    <title>The exon junction complex undergoes a compositional switch that alters
  mRNP structure and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay activity</title>
    <summary>  The exon junction complex (EJC) deposited upstream of mRNA exon junctions
shapes structure, composition and fate of spliced mRNA ribonucleoprotein
particles (mRNPs). To achieve this, the EJC core nucleates assembly of a
dynamic shell of peripheral proteins that function in diverse
post-transcriptional processes. To illuminate consequences of EJC composition
change, we purified EJCs from human cells via peripheral proteins RNPS1 and
CASC3. We show that EJC originates as an SR-rich mega-dalton sized RNP that
contains RNPS1 but lacks CASC3. After mRNP export to the cytoplasm and before
translation, the EJC undergoes a remarkable compositional and structural
remodeling into an SR-devoid monomeric complex that contains CASC3.
Surprisingly, RNPS1 is important for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in
general whereas CASC3 is needed for NMD of only select mRNAs. The promotion of
switch to CASC3-EJC slows down NMD. Overall, the EJC compositional switch
dramatically alters mRNP structure and specifies two distinct phases of
EJC-dependent NMD.

    <title>Genesis of the $αβ$ T-cell receptor</title>
    <summary>  The T-cell (TCR) repertoire relies on the diversity of receptors composed of
two chains, called $\alpha$ and $\beta$, to recognize pathogens. Using results
of high throughput sequencing and computational chain-pairing experiments of
human TCR repertoires, we quantitively characterize the $\alpha\beta$
generation process. We estimate the probabilities of a rescue recombination of
the $\beta$ chain on the second chromosome upon failure or success on the first
chromosome. Unlike $\beta$ chains, $\alpha$ chains recombine simultaneously on
both chromosomes, resulting in correlated statistics of the two genes which we
predict using a mechanistic model. We find that $\sim 28 \%$ of cells express
both $\alpha$ chains. We report that clones sharing the same $\beta$ chain but
different $\alpha$ chains are overrepresented, suggesting that they respond to
common immune challenges. Altogether, our statistical analysis gives a complete
quantitative mechanistic picture that results in the observed correlations in
the generative process. We learn that the probability to generate any
TCR$\alpha\beta$ is lower than $10^{-12}$ making it very unlikely for two
people to share a full receptor by chance. We also estimate the generation
diversity of the full TCR repertoire.

    <title>Deep SNP: An End-to-end Deep Neural Network with Attention-based
  Localization for Break-point Detection in SNP Array Genomic data</title>
    <summary>  Diagnosis and risk stratification of cancer and many other diseases require
the detection of genomic breakpoints as a prerequisite of calling copy number
alterations (CNA). This, however, is still challenging and requires
time-consuming manual curation. As deep-learning methods outperformed classical
state-of-the-art algorithms in various domains and have also been successfully
applied to life science problems including medicine and biology, we here
propose Deep SNP, a novel Deep Neural Network to learn from genomic data.
Specifically, we used a manually curated dataset from 12 genomic single
nucleotide polymorphism array (SNPa) profiles as truth-set and aimed at
predicting the presence or absence of genomic breakpoints, an indicator of
structural chromosomal variations, in windows of 40,000 probes. We compare our
results with well-known neural network models as well as Rawcopy though this
tool is designed to predict breakpoints and in addition genomic segments with
high sensitivity. We show, that Deep SNP is capable of successfully predicting
the presence or absence of a breakpoint in large genomic windows and
outperforms state-of-the-art neural network models. Qualitative examples
suggest that integration of a localization unit may enable breakpoint detection
and prediction of genomic segments, even if the breakpoint coordinates were not
provided for network training. These results warrant further evaluation of
DeepSNP for breakpoint localization and subsequent calling of genomic segments.

    <title>Innovative method for reducing uninformative calls in non-invasive
  prenatal testing</title>
    <summary>  Non-invasive prenatal testing or NIPT is currently among the top researched
topic in obstetric care. While the performance of the current state-of-the-art
NIPT solutions achieve high sensitivity and specificity, they still struggle
with a considerable number of samples that cannot be concluded with certainty.
Such uninformative results are often subject to repeated blood sampling and
re-analysis, usually after two weeks, and this period may cause a stress to the
future mothers as well as increase the overall cost of the test. We propose a
supplementary method to traditional z-scores to reduce the number of such
uninformative calls. The method is based on a novel analysis of the length
profile of circulating cell free DNA which compares the change in such profiles
when random-based and length-based elimination of some fragments is performed.
The proposed method is not as accurate as the standard z-score; however, our
results suggest that combination of these two independent methods correctly
resolves a substantial portion of healthy samples with an uninformative result.
Additionally, we discuss how the proposed method can be used to identify
maternal aberrations, thus reducing the risk of false positive and false
negative calls.

    <title>Identifying viruses from metagenomic data by deep learning</title>
    <summary>  The recent development of metagenomic sequencing makes it possible to
sequence microbial genomes including viruses in an environmental sample.
Identifying viral sequences from metagenomic data is critical for downstream
virus analyses. The existing reference-based and gene homology-based methods
are not efficient in identifying unknown viruses or short viral sequences. Here
we have developed a reference-free and alignment-free machine learning method,
DeepVirFinder, for predicting viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep
learning techniques. DeepVirFinder was trained based on a large number of viral
sequences discovered before May 2015. Evaluated on the sequences after that
date, DeepVirFinder outperformed the state-of-the-art method VirFinder at all
contig lengths. Enlarging the training data by adding millions of purified
viral sequences from environmental metavirome samples significantly improves
the accuracy for predicting under-represented viruses. Applying DeepVirFinder
to real human gut metagenomic samples from patients with colorectal carcinoma
(CRC) identified 51,138 viral sequences belonging to 175 bins. Ten bins were
associated with the cancer status, indicating their potential use for
non-invasive diagnosis of CRC. In summary, DeepVirFinder greatly improved the
precision and recall rates of viral identification, and it will significantly
accelerate the discovery rate of viruses.

    <title>Towards Gene Expression Convolutions using Gene Interaction Graphs</title>
    <summary>  We study the challenges of applying deep learning to gene expression data. We
find experimentally that there exists non-linear signal in the data, however is
it not discovered automatically given the noise and low numbers of samples used
in most research. We discuss how gene interaction graphs (same pathway,
protein-protein, co-expression, or research paper text association) can be used
to impose a bias on a deep model similar to the spatial bias imposed by
convolutions on an image. We explore the usage of Graph Convolutional Neural
Networks coupled with dropout and gene embeddings to utilize the graph
information. We find this approach provides an advantage for particular tasks
in a low data regime but is very dependent on the quality of the graph used. We
conclude that more work should be done in this direction. We design experiments
that show why existing methods fail to capture signal that is present in the
data when features are added which clearly isolates the problem that needs to
be addressed.

    <title>The Reduced PC-Algorithm: Improved Causal Structure Learning in Large
  Random Networks</title>
    <summary>  We consider the task of estimating a high-dimensional directed acyclic graph,
given observations from a linear structural equation model with arbitrary noise
distribution. By exploiting properties of common random graphs, we develop a
new algorithm that requires conditioning only on small sets of variables. The
proposed algorithm, which is essentially a modified version of the
PC-Algorithm, offers significant gains in both computational complexity and
estimation accuracy. In particular, it results in more efficient and accurate
estimation in large networks containing hub nodes, which are common in
biological systems. We prove the consistency of the proposed algorithm, and
show that it also requires a less stringent faithfulness assumption than the
PC-Algorithm. Simulations in low and high-dimensional settings are used to
illustrate these findings. An application to gene expression data suggests that
the proposed algorithm can identify a greater number of clinically relevant
genes than current methods.

    <title>CAMIRADA: Cancer microRNA association discovery algorithm, a case study
  on breast cancer</title>
    <summary>  In recent studies, non-coding protein RNAs have been identified as microRNA
that can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment of cancer,
that decrease mortality in cancer. A microRNA may target hundreds or thousands
of genes and a gene may regulate several microRNAs, so determining which
microRNA is associated with which cancer is a big challenge. Many computational
methods have been performed to detect micoRNAs association with cancer, but
more effort is needed with higher accuracy. Increasing research has shown that
relationship between microRNAs and TFs play a significant role in the diagnosis
of cancer. Therefore, we developed a new computational framework (CAMIRADA) to
identify cancer-related microRNA based on the relationship between microRNAs
and disease genes (DG) in the protein network, the functional relationships
between microRNAs and Transcription Factors (TF) on the co-expression network,
and the relationship between microRNAs and the Differential Expression Gene
(DEG) on co-expression network. The CAMIRADA was applied to assess breast
cancer data from two HMDD and miR2Disease databases. In this study, the AUC for
the 65 microRNA of the top of the list was 0.95, which was more accurate than
the similar methods used to detect microRNA associated with the cancer artery.

    <title>Cell Identity Codes: Understanding Cell Identity from Gene Expression
  Profiles using Deep Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Understanding cell identity is an important task in many biomedical areas.
Expression patterns of specific marker genes have been used to characterize
some limited cell types, but exclusive markers are not available for many cell
types. A second approach is to use machine learning to discriminate cell types
based on the whole gene expression profiles (GEPs). The accuracies of simple
classification algorithms such as linear discriminators or support vector
machines are limited due to the complexity of biological systems. We used deep
neural networks to analyze 1040 GEPs from 16 different human tissues and cell
types. After comparing different architectures, we identified a specific
structure of deep autoencoders that can encode a GEP into a vector of 30
numeric values, which we call the cell identity code (CIC). The original GEP
can be reproduced from the CIC with an accuracy comparable to technical
replicates of the same experiment. Although we use an unsupervised approach to
train the autoencoder, we show different values of the CIC are connected to
different biological aspects of the cell, such as different pathways or
biological processes. This network can use CIC to reproduce the GEP of the cell
types it has never seen during the training. It also can resist some noise in
the measurement of the GEP. Furthermore, we introduce classifier autoencoder,
an architecture that can accurately identify cell type based on the GEP or the
CIC.

    <title>CLEAR: Coverage-based Limiting-cell Experiment Analysis for RNA-seq</title>
    <summary>  Direct cDNA preamplification protocols developed for single-cell RNA-seq
(scRNA-seq) have enabled transcriptome profiling of rare cells without having
to pool multiple samples or to perform RNA extraction. We term this approach
limiting-cell RNA-seq (lcRNA-seq). Unlike scRNA-seq, which focuses on
'cell-atlasing', lcRNA-seq focuses on identifying differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between experimental groups. This requires accounting for systems
noise which can obscure biological differences. We present CLEAR, a workflow
that identifies robust transcripts in lcRNA-seq data for between-group
comparisons. To develop CLEAR, we compared DEGs from RNA extracted from
FACS-derived CD5+ and CD5- cells from a single chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patient diluted to input RNA levels of 10-, 100- and 1,000pg. Data quality at
ultralow input levels are known to be noisy. When using CLEAR transcripts vs.
using all available transcripts, downstream analyses reveal more shared DEGs,
improved Principal Component Analysis separation of cell type, and increased
similarity between results across different input RNA amounts. CLEAR was
applied to two publicly available ultralow input RNA-seq data and an in-house
murine neural cell lcRNA-seq dataset. CLEAR provides a novel way to visualize
the public datasets while validates cell phenotype markers for astrocytes,
neural stem and progenitor cells.

    <title>Chromosomal rearrangements as a source of new gene formation in
  Drosophila yakuba</title>
    <summary>  We provide evidence that chromosomal rearrangements are a source of novel
genetic variation that facilitates the formation of de novo genes in
Drosophila. We identify 52 cases of de novo gene formation created by
chromosomal rearrangements in 14 strains of D. yakuba. These new genes inherit
transcription start signals and open reading frames when the 5' end of existing
genes are combined with previously untranscribed regions. Such new genes would
appear with novel peptide sequences, without the necessity for secondary
transitions from non-coding RNA to protein. This mechanism of new peptide
formations contrasts with canonical theory of de novo gene progression
requiring non-coding intermediaries that must acquire new mutations prior to
loss via pseudogenization. Hence, these mutations offer a means to de novo gene
creation and protein sequence formation in a single mutational step, answering
a long standing open question concerning new gene formation. We further
identify gene expression changes to 134 existing genes, indicating that these
mutations can alter gene regulation. Population variability for chromosomal
rearrangements is considerable, with 2368 rearrangements observed across 14
inbred lines. More rearrangements were identified on the X chromosome than any
of the autosomes, suggesting the X is more susceptible to chromosome
alterations. Together, these results suggest that chromosomal rearrangements
are a source of variation in populations that is likely to be important to
explain genetic and therefore phenotypic diversity.

    <title>Holographic Neural Architectures</title>
    <summary>  Representation learning is at the heart of what makes deep learning
effective. In this work, we introduce a new framework for representation
learning that we call "Holographic Neural Architectures" (HNAs). In the same
way that an observer can experience the 3D structure of a holographed object by
looking at its hologram from several angles, HNAs derive Holographic
Representations from the training set. These representations can then be
explored by moving along a continuous bounded single dimension. We show that
HNAs can be used to make generative networks, state-of-the-art regression
models and that they are inherently highly resistant to noise. Finally, we
argue that because of their denoising abilities and their capacity to
generalize well from very few examples, models based upon HNAs are particularly
well suited for biological applications where training examples are rare or
noisy.

    <title>Molecular Regulation of Histamine Synthesis</title>
    <summary>  Histamine is a critical mediator of IgE/ cell-mediated anaphylaxis, a
neurotransmitter and a regulator of gastric acid secretion. Histamine is a
monoamine synthesized from the amino acid histidine through a reaction
catalyzed by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which removes carboxyl
group from histidine. Despite the importance of histamine, transcriptional
regulation of HDC gene expression in mammals is still poorly understood. In
this Review, we focus on discussing advances in the understanding of molecular
regulation of mammalian histamine synthesis.

    <title>A Survey of the State-of-the-Art Parallel Multiple Sequence Alignment
  Algorithms on Multicore Systems</title>
    <summary>  Evolutionary modeling applications are the best way to provide full
information to support in-depth understanding of evaluation of organisms. These
applications mainly depend on identifying the evolutionary history of existing
organisms and understanding the relations between them, which is possible
through the deep analysis of their biological sequences. Multiple Sequence
Alignment (MSA) is considered an important tool in such applications, where it
gives an accurate representation of the relations between different biological
sequences. In literature, many efforts have been put into presenting a new MSA
algorithm or even improving existing ones. However, little efforts on
optimizing parallel MSA algorithms have been done. Nowadays, large datasets
become a reality, and big data become a primary challenge in various fields,
which should be also a new milestone for new bioinformatics algorithms. This
survey presents four of the state-of-the-art parallel MSA algorithms, TCoffee,
MAFFT, MSAProbs, and M2Align. We provide a detailed discussion of each
algorithm including its strengths, weaknesses, and implementation details and
the effectiveness of its parallel implementation compared to the other
algorithms, taking into account the MSA accuracy on two different datasets,
BAliBASE and OXBench.

    <title>Distribution of the Length-10 Erdos Sequence in the Human Genome</title>
    <summary>  In 1932, Paul Erdos asked whether a random walk constructed from a binary
sequence can achieve, for the sequence itself and for all its subsequences
formed by homogeneous arithmetic progressions, the lowest possible deviation
(lowest discrepancy). Although avoiding low discrepancy is impossible for
infinite sequences, as recently proven by Terence Tao, attempts were made to
construct such sequences with finite lengths. We recognize that such
constructed sequences (we call these "Erdos sequences") exhibit certain
hallmarks of randomness at the local level: they show roughly equal frequencies
of subsequences, and at the same time exclude the trivial periodic patterns.
For the human DNA we examine the frequency of a set of Erdos motifs of
length-10 using three nucleotides-to-binary mappings. The particular length-10
Erdos sequence is derived by the length-11 Mathias sequence and is identical
with the first 10 digits of the Thue-Morse sequence, underscoring the fact that
both are deficient in periodicities. Our calculations indicate that: (1) the
purine (A and G)/pyridimine (C and T) based Erdos motifs are greatly
under-represented in the human genome, (2) the strong(G and C)/weak(A and T)
based Erdos motifs are slightly over-represented, (3) the densities of the two
are negatively correlated, (4) Erdos motifs based on all three mappings being
combined are slightly under-represented, and (5) the strong/weak based Erdos
motifs are greatly over-represented in the human messenger RNA sequences,
possibly caused by an overlooked pattern in the Erdos sequence.

    <title>copMEM: Finding maximal exact matches via sampling both genomes</title>
    <summary>  Genome-to-genome comparisons require designating anchor points, which are
given by Maximum Exact Matches (MEMs) between their sequences. For large
genomes this is a challenging problem and the performance of existing
solutions, even in parallel regimes, is not quite satisfactory. We present a
new algorithm, copMEM, that allows to sparsely sample both input genomes, with
sampling steps being coprime. Despite being a single-threaded implementation,
copMEM computes all MEMs of minimum length 100 between the human and mouse
genomes in less than 2 minutes, using less than 10 GB of RAM memory.

    <title>Inference of gene loss rates after whole genome duplications at early
  vertebrates through ancient genome reconstructions</title>
    <summary>  The famous 2R hypothesis was first proposed by Susumu Ohno in 1970. It states
that the two whole genome duplications had shaped the genome of early
vertebrates. The most convincing evidence for 2R hypothesis comes from the 4:1
ratio chromosomal regions that have preserved both gene content and order in
vertebrates compared with closely related. However, due to the shortage of such
strict evidence, the 2R hypothesis is still under debates.
  Here, we present a combined perspective of phylogenetic and genomic homology
to revisit the hypothesis of 2R whole genome duplications. Ancestral vertebrate
genomes as well as ancient duplication events were created from 17 extant
vertebrate species. Extant descendants from the duplication events at early
vertebrates were extracted and reorganized to partial genomes. We then examined
the gene order based synteny, and projected back to phylogenetic gene trees for
examination of synteny evidence of the reconstructed early vertebrate genes. We
identified 7877 ancestral genes that were created from 3026 duplication events
at early vertebrates, and more than 50% of the duplication events show synteny
evidence. Thus, our reconstructions provide very strong evidence for the 2R
hypothesis.
  We also reconstructed the genome of early vertebrates, and built a model of
the gene gains and losses in early vertebrates. We estimated that there were
about 12,000 genes in early vertebrates before 2R, and the probability of a
random gene get lost after the first round of whole genome duplication is
around 0.45, and the probability of a random gene get lost after the second
round of whole genome duplication is around 0.55.
  This research provides convincing evidence for the 2R hypothesis, and may
provide further insights in vertebral evolution.

    <title>Information Constraints on Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes</title>
    <summary>  Parameterizing the approximate posterior of a generative model with neural
networks has become a common theme in recent machine learning research. While
providing appealing flexibility, this approach makes it difficult to impose or
assess structural constraints such as conditional independence. We propose a
framework for learning representations that relies on Auto-Encoding Variational
Bayes and whose search space is constrained via kernel-based measures of
independence. In particular, our method employs the $d$-variable
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (dHSIC) to enforce independence between
the latent representations and arbitrary nuisance factors. We show how to apply
this method to a range of problems, including the problems of learning
invariant representations and the learning of interpretable representations. We
also present a full-fledged application to single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq). In this setting the biological signal in mixed in complex ways
with sequencing errors and sampling effects. We show that our method
out-performs the state-of-the-art in this domain.

elucidating gene set individually, inter gene sets association is rarely taken
into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging machine learning technique in
computational biology, can be used to generate an unbiased combination of gene
set, and to determine the biological relevance and analysis consistency of
these combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets. In this study,
we proposed a gene superset autoencoder (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model
with the incorporation of a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial
biological features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the gene
superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights trained by the
autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer is a superset. Trained with
genomic data from TCGA and evaluated with their accompanying clinical
parameters, we showed gene supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes
and their prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological
relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant supersets. Using
autoencoder model and gene superset at its latent layer, we demonstrated that
gene supersets retain sufficient biological information with respect to tumor
subtypes and clinical prognostic significance. Superset also provides high
reproducibility on survival analysis and accurate prediction for cancer
subtypes.

    <title>Predicting drug response of tumors from integrated genomic profiles by
  deep neural networks</title>
    <summary>  The study of high-throughput genomic profiles from a pharmacogenomics
viewpoint has provided unprecedented insights into the oncogenic features
modulating drug response. A recent screening of ~1,000 cancer cell lines to a
collection of anti-cancer drugs illuminated the link between genotypes and
vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and
tumors, the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains
challenging. Here we proposed a DNN model to predict drug response based on
mutation and expression profiles of a cancer cell or a tumor. The model
contains a mutation and an expression encoders pre-trained using a large
pan-cancer dataset to abstract core representations of high-dimension data,
followed by a drug response predictor network. Given a pair of mutation and
expression profiles, the model predicts IC50 values of 265 drugs. We trained
and tested the model on a dataset of 622 cancer cell lines and achieved an
overall prediction performance of mean squared error at 1.96 (log-scale IC50
values). The performance was superior in prediction error or stability than two
classical methods and four analog DNNs of our model. We then applied the model
to predict drug response of 9,059 tumors of 33 cancer types. The model
predicted both known, including EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer
and tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer, and novel drug targets. The comprehensive
analysis further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to
a chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in a pan-cancer setting and the anti-cancer
potential of a novel agent, CX-5461, in treating gliomas and hematopoietic
malignancies. Overall, our model and findings improve the prediction of drug
response and the identification of novel therapeutic options.

    <title>The sequencing and interpretation of the genome obtained from a Serbian
  individual</title>
    <summary>  Recent genetic studies and whole-genome sequencing projects have greatly
improved our understanding of human variation and clinically actionable genetic
information. Smaller ethnic populations, however, remain underrepresented in
both individual and large-scale sequencing efforts and hence present an
opportunity to discover new variants of biomedical and demographic
significance. This report describes the sequencing and analysis of a genome
obtained from an individual of Serbian origin, introducing tens of thousands of
previously unknown variants to the currently available pool. Ancestry analysis
places this individual in close proximity of the Central and Eastern European
populations; i.e., closest to Croatian, Bulgarian and Hungarian individuals
and, in terms of other Europeans, furthest from Ashkenazi Jewish, Spanish,
Sicilian, and Baltic individuals. Our analysis confirmed gene flow between
Neanderthal and ancestral pan-European populations, with similar contributions
to the Serbian genome as those observed in other European groups. Finally, to
assess the burden of potentially disease-causing/clinically relevant variation
in the sequenced genome, we utilized manually curated genotype-phenotype
association databases and variant-effect predictors. We identified several
variants that have previously been associated with severe early-onset disease
that is not evident in the proband, as well as variants that could yet prove to
be clinically relevant to the proband over the next decades. The presence of
numerous private and low-frequency variants along with the observed and
predicted disease-causing mutations in this genome exemplify some of the global
challenges of genome interpretation, especially in the context of understudied
ethnic groups.

    <title>The Qatar Genome: A Population-Specific Tool for Precision Medicine in
  the Middle East</title>
    <summary>  Reaching the full potential of precision medicine depends on the quality of
personalized genome interpretation. In order to facilitate precision medicine
in regions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a population-specific
reference genome for the indigenous Arab popula-tion of Qatar (QTRG) was
constructed by incorporating allele frequency data from sequencing of 1,161
Qataris, representing 0.4% of the population. A total of 20.9 million SNP and
3.1 million indels were observed in Qatar, including an average of 1.79% novel
variants per individual ge-nome. Replacement of the GRCh37 standard reference
with QTRG in a best practices genome analysis workflow resulted in an average
of 7* deeper coverage depth (an improvement of 23%), and 756,671 fewer variants
on average, a reduction of 16% that is attributed to common Qatari alleles
being present in the QTRG reference. The benefit for using QTRG varies across
ances-tries, a factor that should be taken into consideration when selecting an
appropriate reference for analysis.

    <title>TensOrMachine: Probabilistic Boolean Tensor Decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Boolean tensor decomposition approximates data of multi-way binary
relationships as product of interpretable low-rank binary factors, following
the rules of Boolean algebra. Here, we present its first probabilistic
treatment. We facilitate scalable sampling-based posterior inference by
exploitation of the combinatorial structure of the factor conditionals. Maximum
a posteriori decompositions feature higher accuracies than existing techniques
throughout a wide range of simulated conditions. Moreover, the probabilistic
approach facilitates the treatment of missing data and enables model selection
with much greater accuracy. We investigate three real-world data-sets. First,
temporal interaction networks in a hospital ward and behavioural data of
university students demonstrate the inference of instructive latent patterns.
Next, we decompose a tensor with more than 10 billion data points, indicating
relations of gene expression in cancer patients. Not only does this demonstrate
scalability, it also provides an entirely novel perspective on relational
properties of continuous data and, in the present example, on the molecular
heterogeneity of cancer. Our implementation is available on GitHub:

    <title>Bivariate Causal Discovery and its Applications to Gene Expression and
  Imaging Data Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The mainstream of research in genetics, epigenetics and imaging data analysis
focuses on statistical association or exploring statistical dependence between
variables. Despite their significant progresses in genetic research,
understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive.
Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data
analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic
science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential
component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex
phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to
causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering and
biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least
three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL,
mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal
relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal
discovery. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a
basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and
additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery.
Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the
ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for
causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene
regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data
analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and
association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence
of causation, while lack of association between two variables.

    <title>Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Via Machine Learning Ensembles</title>
    <summary>  We present ensemble methods in a machine learning (ML) framework combining
predictions from five known motif/binding site exploration algorithms. For a
given TF the ensemble starts with position weight matrices (PWM's) for the
motif, collected from the component algorithms. Using dimension reduction, we
identify significant PWM-based subspaces for analysis. Within each subspace a
machine classifier is built for identifying the TF's gene (promoter) targets
(Problem 1). These PWM-based subspaces form an ML-based sequence analysis tool.
Problem 2 (finding binding motifs) is solved by agglomerating k-mer (string)
feature PWM-based subspaces that stand out in identifying gene targets. We
approach Problem 3 (binding sites) with a novel machine learning approach that
uses promoter string features and ML importance scores in a classification
algorithm locating binding sites across the genome. For target gene
identification this method improves performance (measured by the F1 score) by
about 10 percentage points over the (a) motif scanning method and (b) the
coexpression-based association method. Top motif outperformed 5 component
algorithms as well as two other common algorithms (BEST and DEME). For
identifying individual binding sites on a benchmark cross species database
(Tompa et al., 2005) we match the best performer without much human
intervention. It also improved the performance on mammalian TFs.
  The ensemble can integrate orthogonal information from different weak
learners (potentially using entirely different types of features) into a
machine learner that can perform consistently better for more TFs. The TF gene
target identification component (problem 1 above) is useful in constructing a
transcriptional regulatory network from known TF-target associations. The
ensemble is easily extendable to include more tools as well as future PWM-based
information.

    <title>A quick guide for student-driven community genome annotation</title>
    <summary>  High quality gene models are necessary to expand the molecular and genetic
tools available for a target organism, but these are available for only a
handful of model organisms that have undergone extensive curation and
experimental validation over the course of many years. The majority of gene
models present in biological databases today have been identified in draft
genome assemblies using automated annotation pipelines that are frequently
based on orthologs from distantly related model organisms. Manual curation is
time consuming and often requires substantial expertise, but is instrumental in
improving gene model structure and identification. Manual annotation may seem
to be a daunting and cost-prohibitive task for small research communities but
involving undergraduates in community genome annotation consortiums can be
mutually beneficial for both education and improved genomic resources. We
outline a workflow for efficient manual annotation driven by a team of
primarily undergraduate annotators. This model can be scaled to large teams and
includes quality control processes through incremental evaluation. Moreover, it
gives students an opportunity to increase their understanding of genome biology
and to participate in scientific research in collaboration with peers and
senior researchers at multiple institutions.

    <title>Deep Learning for Genomics: A Concise Overview</title>
    <summary>  Advancements in genomic research such as high-throughput sequencing
techniques have driven modern genomic studies into "big data" disciplines. This
data explosion is constantly challenging conventional methods used in genomics.
In parallel with the urgent demand for robust algorithms, deep learning has
succeeded in a variety of fields such as vision, speech, and text processing.
Yet genomics entails unique challenges to deep learning since we are expecting
from deep learning a superhuman intelligence that explores beyond our knowledge
to interpret the genome. A powerful deep learning model should rely on
insightful utilization of task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we briefly
discuss the strengths of different deep learning models from a genomic
perspective so as to fit each particular task with a proper deep architecture,
and remark on practical considerations of developing modern deep learning
architectures for genomics. We also provide a concise review of deep learning
applications in various aspects of genomic research, as well as pointing out
potential opportunities and obstacles for future genomics applications.

    <title>GeneVis - An interactive visualization tool for combining
  cross-discipline datasets within genetics</title>
    <summary>  GeneVis is a web-based tool to visualize complementary data sets of different
disciplines within the field of genetics. It overlays gene-cluster information,
gene-interaction data and gene-disease association data by means of web-based
interactive graph visualizations. This allows an intuitive and quick assessment
of possible relations between the different datasets. By starting from a
high-level graph abstraction based on gene clusters, which can be selected for
detailed inspection at the gene-interaction level in a separate window, GeneVis
circumvents the common visual clutter problem when using gene datasets with a
high number of gene entries.

    <title>A Markovian genomic concatenation model guided by persymmetric matrices</title>
    <summary>  Sobottka and Hart (2011) made use of a Markovian concatenation model to
observe novel statistical symmetries in the mononucleotide and dinucleotide
distributions of a collection of bacterial chromosomes. The model roughly
approximates the first-order stochastic structure of DNA sequences by means of
a Markov chain whose one-step transition matrix is obtained from a
concatenation process guided by a positive persymmetric matrix $\mathfrak{L}$
of probabilities together with a positive parameter $m$. In this article we
carry out a detailed analysis of such stochastic matrices, here called
$\aleph$-generated matrices, and draw a number of conclusions. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for a stochastic matrix to be $\aleph$-generated are
given, as well as a way to determine if two $\aleph$-generated matrices can be
generated using the same persymmetric matrix with different values of $m$. The
results obtained in this research can be used to design new algorithms for
statistical analyses of real bacterial genomes.

    <title>Prediction of a Gene Regulatory Network from Gene Expression Profiles
  With Linear Regression and Pearson Correlation Coefficient</title>
    <summary>  Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks is the process of identifying gene
dependency from gene expression profile through some computation techniques. In
our human body, though all cells pose similar genetic material but the
activation state may vary. This variation in the activation of genes helps
researchers to understand more about the function of the cells. Researchers get
insight about diseases like mental illness, infectious disease, cancer disease
and heart disease from microarray technology, etc. In this study, a
cancer-specific gene regulatory network has been constructed using a simple and
novel machine learning approach. In First Step, linear regression algorithm
provided us the significant genes those expressed themselves differently. Next,
regulatory relationships between the identified genes has been computed using
Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, the obtained results have been
validated with the available databases and literatures. We can identify the hub
genes and can be targeted for the cancer diagnosis.

    <title>Essentiality, conservation, evolutionary pressure and codon bias in
  bacterial genes</title>
    <summary>  Essential genes constitute the core of genes which cannot be mutated too much
nor lost along the evolutionary history of a species. Natural selection is
expected to be stricter on essential genes and on conserved (highly shared)
genes, than on genes that are either nonessential or peculiar to a single or a
few species. In order to further assess this expectation, we study here how
essentiality of a gene is connected with its degree of conservation among
several unrelated bacterial species, each one characterised by its own codon
usage bias. Confirming previous results on E. coli, we show the existence of a
universal exponential relation between gene essentiality and conservation in
bacteria. Moreover we show that, within each bacterial genome, there are at
least two groups of functionally distinct genes, characterised by different
levels of conservation and codon bias: i) a core of essential genes, mainly
related to cellular information processing; ii) a set of less conserved
nonessential genes with prevalent functions related to metabolism. In
particular, the genes in the first group are more retained among species, are
subject to a stronger purifying conservative selection and display a more
limited repertoire of synonymous codons. The core of essential genes is close
to the minimal bacterial genome, which is in the focus of recent studies in
synthetic biology, though we confirm that orthologs of genes that are essential
in one species are not necessarily essential in other species. We also list a
set of highly shared genes which, reasonably, could constitute a reservoir of
targets for new anti-microbial drugs.

    <title>Modeling and analysis of RNA-seq data: a review from a statistical
  perspective</title>
    <summary>  Background: Since the invention of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
technologies, they have become a powerful tool to study the presence and
quantity of RNA molecules in biological samples and have revolutionized
transcriptomic studies. The analysis of RNA-seq data at four different levels
(samples, genes, transcripts, and exons) involve multiple statistical and
computational questions, some of which remain challenging up to date.
  Results: We review RNA-seq analysis tools at the sample, gene, transcript,
and exon levels from a statistical perspective. We also highlight the
biological and statistical questions of most practical considerations.
  Conclusion: The development of statistical and computational methods for
analyzing RNA- seq data has made significant advances in the past decade.
However, methods developed to answer the same biological question often rely on
diverse statical models and exhibit different performance under different
scenarios. This review discusses and compares multiple commonly used
statistical models regarding their assumptions, in the hope of helping users
select appropriate methods as needed, as well as assisting developers for
future method development.

    <title>netgwas: An R Package for Network-Based Genome-Wide Association Studies</title>
    <summary>  Although Genome-Wide Association Studies provide a large number of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the data are often analyzed one SNP at a time.
The low power of single SNPs analysis, combined with the high significance
threshold for performing multiple testing correction, substantially reduces the
power of GWAS. Graphical models are powerful tools for modeling and making
statistical inferences regarding complex associations among variables in
multivariate data. They are capable of adjusting the effect of all other
variables while measuring the pairwise associations. In this paper we introduce
the R package netgwas, which is designed based on graphical models to
accomplish three important and interrelated goals in genetics: constructing
linkage map, reconstructing linkage disequilibrium networks from multi-loci
genotype data, and detecting high-dimensional genotype-phenotype networks. The
netgwas package can deal with species of any ploidy level. It implements recent
improvements in both linkage map construction, and reconstructing conditional
independence network for non-Gaussian data, discrete data, and mixed
discrete-and-continuous data. Such datasets routinely occur in genetics and
genomics such as genotype data, genotype-phenotype data, and multi-loci
multi-trait multi-environment data. We demonstrate the value of our package
functionality by applying it to five multivariate example datasets taken from
the literature. We show, in particular, that our package allows a more
realistic analysis of data, as accounts for simultaneous interactions among
variables. This rules out spurious associations between variables that can
arise from classical multiple testing approach. The package uses a
parallelization strategy on multi-core processors to speed-up computations for
large datasets. The netgwas package is freely available at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netgwas.

    <title>FPGA Acceleration of Short Read Alignment</title>
    <summary>  Aligning millions of short DNA or RNA reads, of 75 to 250 base pairs each, to
a reference genome is a significant computation problem in bioinformatics. We
present a flexible and fast FPGA-based short read alignment tool. Our aligner
makes use of the processing power of FPGAs in conjunction with the greater host
memory bandwidth and flexibility of software to improve performance and achieve
a high level of configurability. This flexible design supports a variety of
reference genome sizes without the performance degradation suffered by other
software and FPGA-based aligners. It is also better able to support the
features of new alignment algorithms, which frequently crop up in the rapidly
evolving field of bioinformatics. We demonstrate these advantages in a case
study where we align RNA-Seq data from a hypothesized mouse / human xenograft.
In this case study, our aligner provides a speedup of 5.6x over BWA-SW with
energy savings of 21%, while also reducing incorrect short read classification
by 29%. To demonstrate the flexibility of our system we show that the speedup
can be substantially improved while retaining most of the accuracy gains over
BWA-SW. The speedup can be increased to 71.3x, while still enjoying a 28%
incorrect classification improvement and 52% improvement in unaligned reads.

    <title>Joint Analysis of Individual-level and Summary-level GWAS Data by
  Leveraging Pleiotropy</title>
    <summary>  A large number of recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for complex
phenotypes confirm the early conjecture for polygenicity, suggesting the
presence of large number of variants with only tiny or moderate effects.
However, due to the limited sample size of a single GWAS, many associated
genetic variants are too weak to achieve the genome-wide significance. These
undiscovered variants further limit the prediction capability of GWAS.
Restricted access to the individual-level data and the increasing availability
of the published GWAS results motivate the development of methods integrating
both the individual-level and summary-level data. How to build the connection
between the individual-level and summary-level data determines the efficiency
of using the existing abundant summary-level resources with limited
individual-level data, and this issue inspires more efforts in the existing
area.
  In this study, we propose a novel statistical approach, LEP, which provides a
novel way of modeling the connection between the individual-level data and
summary-level data. LEP integrates both types of data by \underline{LE}veraing
\underline{P}leiotropy to increase the statistical power of risk variants
identification and the accuracy of risk prediction. The algorithm for parameter
estimation is developed to handle genome-wide-scale data. Through comprehensive
simulation studies, we demonstrated the advantages of LEP over the existing
methods. We further applied LEP to perform integrative analysis of Crohn's
disease from WTCCC and summary statistics from GWAS of some other diseases,
such as Type 1 diabetes, Ulcerative colitis and Primary biliary cirrhosis. LEP
was able to significantly increase the statistical power of identifying risk
variants and improve the risk prediction accuracy from 63.39\% ($\pm$ 0.58\%)
to 68.33\% ($\pm$ 0.32\%) using about 195,000 variants.

    <title>Statistics of shared components in complex component systems</title>
    <summary>  Many complex systems are modular. Such systems can be represented as
"component systems", i.e., sets of elementary components, such as LEGO bricks
in LEGO sets. The bricks found in a LEGO set reflect a target architecture,
which can be built following a set-specific list of instructions. In other
component systems, instead, the underlying functional design and constraints
are not obvious a priori, and their detection is often a challenge of both
scientific and practical importance, requiring a clear understanding of
component statistics. Importantly, some quantitative invariants appear to be
common to many component systems, most notably a common broad distribution of
component abundances, which often resembles the well-known Zipf's law. Such
"laws" affect in a general and non-trivial way the component statistics,
potentially hindering the identification of system-specific functional
constraints or generative processes. Here, we specifically focus on the
statistics of shared components, i.e., the distribution of the number of
components shared by different system-realizations, such as the common bricks
found in different LEGO sets. To account for the effects of component
heterogeneity, we consider a simple null model, which builds
system-realizations by random draws from a universe of possible components.
Under general assumptions on abundance heterogeneity, we provide analytical
estimates of component occurrence, which quantify exhaustively the statistics
of shared components. Surprisingly, this simple null model can positively
explain important features of empirical component-occurrence distributions
obtained from data on bacterial genomes, LEGO sets, and book chapters. Specific
architectural features and functional constraints can be detected from
occurrence patterns as deviations from these null predictions, as we show for
the illustrative case of the "core" genome in bacteria.

    <title>Model-based clustering of multi-tissue gene expression data</title>
    <summary>  Recently, it has become feasible to generate large-scale, multi-tissue gene
expression data, where expression profiles are obtained from multiple tissues
or organs sampled from dozens to hundreds of individuals. When traditional
clustering methods are applied to this type of data, important information is
lost, because they either require all tissues to be analyzed independently,
ignoring dependencies and similarities between tissues, or to merge tissues in
a single, monolithic dataset, ignoring individual characteristics of tissues.
We developed a Bayesian model-based multi-tissue clustering algorithm, revamp,
which can incorporate prior information on physiological tissue similarity, and
which results in a set of clusters, each consisting of a core set of genes
conserved across tissues as well as differential sets of genes specific to one
or more subsets of tissues. Using data from seven vascular and metabolic
tissues from over 100 individuals in the STockholm Atherosclerosis Gene
Expression (STAGE) study, we demonstrate that multi-tissue clusters inferred by
revamp are more enriched for tissue-dependent protein-protein interactions
compared to alternative approaches. We further demonstrate that revamp results
in easily interpretable multi-tissue gene expression associations to key
coronary artery disease processes and clinical phenotypes in the STAGE
individuals. Revamp is implemented in the Lemon-Tree software, available at

    <title>Classification of large DNA methylation datasets for identifying cancer
  drivers</title>
    <summary>  DNA methylation is a well-studied genetic modification crucial to regulate
the functioning of the genome. Its alterations play an important role in
tumorigenesis and tumor-suppression. Thus, studying DNA methylation data may
help biomarker discovery in cancer. Since public data on DNA methylation become
abundant, and considering the high number of methylated sites (features)
present in the genome, it is important to have a method for efficiently
processing such large datasets. Relying on big data technologies, we propose
BIGBIOCL an algorithm that can apply supervised classification methods to
datasets with hundreds of thousands of features. It is designed for the
extraction of alternative and equivalent classification models through
iterative deletion of selected features. We run experiments on DNA methylation
datasets extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas, focusing on three tumor types:
breast, kidney, and thyroid carcinomas. We perform classifications extracting
several methylated sites and their associated genes with accurate performance.
Results suggest that BIGBIOCL can perform hundreds of classification iterations
on hundreds of thousands of features in few hours. Moreover, we compare the
performance of our method with other state-of-the-art classifiers and with a
wide-spread DNA methylation analysis method based on network analysis. Finally,
we are able to efficiently compute multiple alternative classification models
and extract, from DNA-methylation large datasets, a set of candidate genes to
be further investigated to determine their active role in cancer. BIGBIOCL,
results of experiments, and a guide to carry on new experiments are freely
available on GitHub.

    <title>Feedback GAN (FBGAN) for DNA: a Novel Feedback-Loop Architecture for
  Optimizing Protein Functions</title>
    <summary>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent an attractive and novel
approach to generate realistic data, such as genes, proteins, or drugs, in
synthetic biology. Here, we apply GANs to generate synthetic DNA sequences
encoding for proteins of variable length. We propose a novel feedback-loop
architecture, called Feedback GAN (FBGAN), to optimize the synthetic gene
sequences for desired properties using an external function analyzer. The
proposed architecture also has the advantage that the analyzer need not be
differentiable. We apply the feedback-loop mechanism to two examples: 1)
generating synthetic genes coding for antimicrobial peptides, and 2) optimizing
synthetic genes for the secondary structure of their resulting peptides. A
suite of metrics demonstrate that the GAN generated proteins have desirable
biophysical properties. The FBGAN architecture can also be used to optimize
GAN-generated datapoints for useful properties in domains beyond genomics.

    <title>Gene Co-expression Network analysis of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma data</title>
    <summary>  We performed a gene co-expression analysis on Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
data to find modules (groups) of genes that may highly impact the growth of
these type of tumors. Additionally, we used cancer survival data to relate
modules to prognostic significance in terms of survival time. Analysis on
RNA-seq data revealed modules which are significant in gene enrichment
analysis. Specifically, two genes - RFC4 and ECT2 - have been found to be
significant in terms of survival time. We also performed a second gene
co-expression analysis on a second dataset of microarray data, and many
significant genes found in this analysis could also be found in the RNA-seq
data implying that these genes might indeed play a crucial role in Lung
Squamous Cancer. All the R code for the analysis can be found at:

    <title>Routinely quantifying single cell proteomes: A new age in quantitative
  biology and medicine</title>
    <summary>  Many pressing medical challenges - such as diagnosing disease, enhancing
directed stem cell differentiation, and classifying cancers - have long been
hindered by limitations in our ability to quantify proteins in single cells.
Mass-spectrometry (MS) is poised to transcend these limitations by developing
powerful methods to routinely quantify thousands of proteins and proteoforms
across many thousands of single cells. We outline specific technological
developments and ideas that can increase the sensitivity and throughput of
single cell MS by orders of magnitude and usher in this new age. These advances
will transform medicine and ultimately contribute to understanding biological
systems on an entirely new level.

    <title>De novo construction of polyploid linkage maps using discrete graphical
  models</title>
    <summary>  Linkage maps are used to identify the location of genes responsible for
traits and diseases. New sequencing techniques have created opportunities to
substantially increase the density of genetic markers. Such revolutionary
advances in technology have given rise to new challenges, such as creating
high-density linkage maps. Current multiple testing approaches based on
pairwise recombination fractions are underpowered in the high-dimensional
setting and do not extend easily to polyploid species. We propose to construct
linkage maps using graphical models either via a sparse Gaussian copula or a
nonparanormal skeptic approach. Linkage groups (LGs), typically chromosomes,
and the order of markers in each LG are determined by inferring the conditional
independence relationships among large numbers of markers in the genome.
Through simulations, we illustrate the utility of our map construction method
and compare its performance with other available methods, both when the data
are clean and contain no missing observations and when data contain genotyping
errors and are incomplete. We apply the proposed method to two genotype
datasets: barley and potato from diploid and polypoid populations,
respectively. Our comprehensive map construction method makes full use of the
dosage SNP data to reconstruct linkage map for any bi-parental diploid and
polyploid species. We have implemented the method in the R package netgwas.

    <title>Alignment-Free Sequence Analysis and Applications</title>
    <summary>  Genome and metagenome comparisons based on large amounts of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) data pose significant challenges for alignment-based
approaches due to the huge data size and the relatively short length of the
reads. Alignment-free approaches based on the counts of word patterns in NGS
data do not depend on the complete genome and are generally computationally
efficient. Thus, they contribute significantly to genome and metagenome
comparison. Recently, novel statistical approaches have been developed for the
comparison of both long and shotgun sequences. These approaches have been
applied to many problems including the comparison of gene regulatory regions,
genome sequences, metagenomes, binning contigs in metagenomic data,
identification of virus-host interactions, and detection of horizontal gene
transfers. We provide an updated review of these applications and other related
developments of word-count based approaches for alignment-free sequence
analysis.

    <title>SIG-DB: leveraging homomorphic encryption to Securely Interrogate
  privately held Genomic DataBases</title>
    <summary>  Genomic data are becoming increasingly valuable as we develop methods to
utilize the information at scale and gain a greater understanding of how
genetic information relates to biological function. Advances in synthetic
biology and the decreased cost of sequencing are increasing the amount of
privately held genomic data. As the quantity and value of private genomic data
grows, so does the incentive to acquire and protect such data, which creates a
need to store and process these data securely. We present an algorithm for the
Secure Interrogation of Genomic DataBases (SIG-DB). The SIG-DB algorithm
enables databases of genomic sequences to be searched with an encrypted query
sequence without revealing the query sequence to the Database Owner or any of
the database sequences to the Querier. SIG-DB is the first application of its
kind to take advantage of locality-sensitive hashing and homomorphic encryption
to allow generalized sequence-to-sequence comparisons of genomic data.

    <title>Role of salt valency in the switch of H-NS proteins between DNA-bridging
  and DNA-stiffening modes</title>
    <summary>  This work investigates the interactions of H-NS proteins and bacterial
genomic DNA through computer simulations performed with a coarse-grained model.
The model was developed specifically to study the switch of H-NS proteins from
the DNA-stiffening to the DNA-bridging mode, which has been observed repeatedly
upon addition of multivalent cations to the buffer, but is still not
understood. Unravelling the corresponding mechanism is all the more crucial, as
the regulation properties of H-NS proteins, as well as other nucleoid proteins,
are linked to their DNA-binding properties. The simulations reported here
support a mechanism, according to which the primary role of multivalent cations
consists in decreasing the strength of H-NS/DNA interactions compared to
H-NS/H-NS interactions, with the latter ones becoming energetically favored
with respect to the former ones above a certain threshold of the effective
valency of the cations of the buffer. Below the threshold, H-NS dimers form
filaments, which stretch along the DNA molecule but are quite inefficient in
bridging genomically distant DNA sites (DNA-stiffening mode). In contrast, just
above the threshold, H-NS dimers form 3-dimensional clusters, which are able to
connect DNA sites that are distant from the genomic point of view (DNA-bridging
mode). The model provides clear rationales for the experimental observations
that the switch between the two modes is a threshold effect and that the
ability of H-NS dimers to form higher order oligomers is crucial for their
bridging capabilities.

    <title>The bromodomain-containing protein Ibd1 links multiple chromatin related
  protein complexes to highly expressed genes in Tetrahymena thermophila</title>
    <summary>  Background: The chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF family are critical
transcriptional regulators. Recognition of lysine acetylation through a
bromodomain (BRD) component is key to SWI/SNF function; in most eukaryotes,
this function is attributed to SNF2/Brg1.
  Results: Using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) we
identified members of a SWI/SNF complex (SWI/SNFTt) in Tetrahymena thermophila.
SWI/SNFTt is composed of 11 proteins, Snf5Tt, Swi1Tt, Swi3Tt, Snf12Tt, Brg1Tt,
two proteins with potential chromatin interacting domains and four proteins
without orthologs to SWI/SNF proteins in yeast or mammals. SWI/SNFTt subunits
localize exclusively to the transcriptionally active macronucleus (MAC) during
growth and development, consistent with a role in transcription. While
Tetrahymena Brg1 does not contain a BRD, our AP-MS results identified a
BRD-containing SWI/SNFTt component, Ibd1 that associates with SWI/SNFTt during
growth but not development. AP-MS analysis of epitope-tagged Ibd1 revealed it
to be a subunit of several additional protein complexes, including putative
SWRTt, and SAGATt complexes as well as a putative H3K4-specific histone methyl
transferase complex. Recombinant Ibd1 recognizes acetyl-lysine marks on
histones correlated with active transcription. Consistent with our AP-MS and
histone array data suggesting a role in regulation of gene expression, ChIP-Seq
analysis of Ibd1 indicated that it primarily binds near promoters and within
gene bodies of highly expressed genes during growth.
  Conclusions: Our results suggest that through recognizing specific histones
marks, Ibd1 targets active chromatin regions of highly expressed genes in
Tetrahymena where it subsequently might coordinate the recruitment of several
chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate the transcriptional landscape of
vegetatively growing Tetrahymena cells.

    <title>Single nucleotide polymorphisms that modulate microRNA regulation of
  gene expression in tumors</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with trait diversity and disease
susceptibility, yet the functional properties of many genetic variants and
their molecular interactions remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that
SNPs in microRNA binding sites may disrupt gene regulation by microRNAs
(miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs that bind to mRNA and downregulate the target
gene. While a number of studies have been conducted to predict the location of
SNPs in miRNA binding sites, to date there has been no comprehensive analysis
of how SNP variants may impact miRNA regulation of genes. Here we investigate
the functional properties of genetic variants and their effects on miRNA
regulation of gene expression in cancer. Our analysis is motivated by the
hypothesis that distinct alleles may cause differential binding (from miRNAs to
mRNAs or from transcription factors to DNA) and change the expression of genes.
We previously identified pathways--systems of genes conferring specific cell
functions--that are dysregulated by miRNAs in cancer, by comparing
miRNA-pathway associations between healthy and tumor tissue. We draw on these
results as a starting point to assess whether SNPs in genes on dysregulated
pathways are responsible for miRNA dysregulation of individual genes in tumors.
Using an integrative analysis that incorporates miRNA expression, mRNA
expression, and SNP genotype data, we identify SNPs that appear to influence
the association between miRNAs and genes, which we term "regulatory QTLs
(regQTLs)": loci whose alleles impact the regulation of genes by miRNAs. We
describe the method, apply it to analyze four cancer types (breast, liver,
lung, prostate) using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and provide a
tool to explore the findings.

    <title>Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long
reads of $\sim$100 kilo bases (kb) in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads
in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 mega bases (Mb) in length.
Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at
scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.
  Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long
mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short
reads of $\ge$100bp in length, $\ge$1kb genomic reads at error rate $\sim$15%,
full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads, and assembly contigs or closely
related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does
split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and
deletions (INDELs) and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments.
It is 3-4 times faster than mainstream short-read mappers at comparable
accuracy and $\ge$30 times faster at higher accuracy for both genomic and mRNA
reads, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

    <title>Performance Analysis of MEC Approach for Haplotype Assembly</title>
    <summary>  The Minimum Error Correction (MEC) approach is used as a metric for
reconstruction of haplotypes from NGS reads. In this paper, we show that the
MEC may encounter with imprecise reconstructed haplotypes for some NGS devices.
Specifically, using mathematical derivations, we evaluate this approach for the
SOLiD, Illumina, 454, Ion, Pacific BioSciences, Oxford Nanopore, and 10X
Genomics devices. Our results reveal that the MEC yields inexact haplotypes for
the Illumina MiniSeq, 454 GS Junior+, Ion PGM 314, and Oxford Nanopore MK 1
MinION.

    <title>Differential Expression Analysis of Dynamical Sequencing Count Data with
  a Gamma Markov Chain</title>
    <summary>  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to profile temporal changes in living
systems is gaining more attention for deriving better insights into the
underlying biological mechanisms compared to traditional static sequencing
experiments. Nonetheless, the majority of existing statistical tools for
analyzing NGS data lack the capability of exploiting the richer information
embedded in temporal data. Several recent tools have been developed to analyze
such data but they typically impose strict model assumptions, such as
smoothness on gene expression dynamic changes. To capture a broader range of
gene expression dynamic patterns, we develop the gamma Markov negative binomial
(GMNB) model that integrates a gamma Markov chain into a negative binomial
distribution model, allowing flexible temporal variation in NGS count data.
Using Bayes factors, GMNB enables more powerful temporal gene differential
expression analysis across different phenotypes or treatment conditions. In
addition, it naturally handles the heterogeneity of sequencing depth in
different samples, removing the need for ad-hoc normalization. Efficient Gibbs
sampling inference of the GMNB model parameters is achieved by exploiting novel
data augmentation techniques. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world RNA-seq data show that GMNB outperforms existing methods in both
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves of
differential expression analysis results.

    <title>Nanopore Sequencing Technology and Tools for Genome Assembly:
  Computational Analysis of the Current State, Bottlenecks and Future
  Directions</title>
    <summary>  Nanopore sequencing technology has the potential to render other sequencing
technologies obsolete with its ability to generate long reads and provide
portability. However, high error rates of the technology pose a challenge while
generating accurate genome assemblies. The tools used for nanopore sequence
analysis are of critical importance as they should overcome the high error
rates of the technology. Our goal in this work is to comprehensively analyze
current publicly available tools for nanopore sequence analysis to understand
their advantages, disadvantages, and performance bottlenecks. It is important
to understand where the current tools do not perform well to develop better
tools. To this end, we 1) analyze the multiple steps and the associated tools
in the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore sequence data, and 2) provide
guidelines for determining the appropriate tools for each step. We analyze
various combinations of different tools and expose the tradeoffs between
accuracy, performance, memory usage and scalability. We conclude that our
observations can guide researchers and practitioners in making conscious and
effective choices for each step of the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore
sequence data. Also, with the help of bottlenecks we have found, developers can
improve the current tools or build new ones that are both accurate and fast, in
order to overcome the high error rates of the nanopore sequencing technology.

    <title>Predicting the spectrum of TCR repertoire sharing with a data-driven
  model of recombination</title>
    <summary>  Despite the extreme diversity of T cell repertoires, many identical T-cell
receptor (TCR) sequences are found in a large number of individual mice and
humans. These widely-shared sequences, often referred to as `public', have been
suggested to be over-represented due to their potential immune functionality or
their ease of generation by V(D)J recombination. Here we show that even for
large cohorts the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between
individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for by the known
quantitative statistical biases in the generation process, together with a
simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many
individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the
sampling depth, as well as on the sequence itself, in agreement with the data.
We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size
and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations we propose
a public/private sequence classifier, `PUBLIC' (Public Universal Binary
Likelihood Inference Classifier), based on the generation probability, which
performs very well even for small cohort sizes.

    <title>Quantum annealing versus classical machine learning applied to a
  simplified computational biology problem</title>
    <summary>  Transcription factors regulate gene expression, but how these proteins
recognize and specifically bind to their DNA targets is still debated. Machine
learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we
studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to predict binding
specificity. Using simplified datasets of a small number of DNA sequences
derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially
available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding.
The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same
simplified datasets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum
annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting.
Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification
performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for
these fairly small training data sets. Thus, we propose that quantum annealing
might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain
computational biology problems.

    <title>IntLIM: Integration using Linear Models of metabolomics and gene
  expression data</title>
    <summary>  Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data improves functional
interpretation of disease-related metabolomic phenotypes, and facilitates
discovery of putative metabolite biomarkers and gene targets. For this reason,
these data are increasingly collected in large cohorts, driving a need for the
development of novel methods for their integration. Of note,
clinical/translational studies typically provide snapshot gene and metabolite
profiles and, oftentimes, most metabolites are not identified. Thus, in these
types of studies, pathway/network approaches that take into account the
complexity of gene-metabolite relationships may neither be applicable nor
readily uncover novel relationships. With this in mind, we propose a simple
linear modeling approach to capture phenotype-specific gene-metabolite
associations, with the assumption that co-regulation patterns reflect
functionally related genes and metabolites. The proposed linear model,
metabolite ~ gene + phenotype + gene:phenotype, specifically evaluates whether
gene-metabolite relationships differ by phenotype, by testing whether the
relationship in one phenotype is significantly different from the relationship
in another phenotype (via an interaction gene:phenotype p-value). Interaction
p-values for all possible gene-metabolite pairs are computed and significant
pairs are clustered by the directionality of associations. We implemented our
approach as an R package, IntLIM, which includes a user-friendly Shiny app. We
applied IntLIM to two published datasets, collected in NCI-60 cell lines and in
human breast tumor and non-tumor tissue. We demonstrate that IntLIM captures
relevant tumor-specific gene-metabolite associations involved in cancer-related
pathways. and also uncover novel relationships that could be tested
experimentally. The IntLIM R package is publicly available in GitHub
(https://github.com/mathelab/IntLIM).

    <title>DropLasso: A robust variant of Lasso for single cell RNA-seq data</title>
    <summary>  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a fast growing approach to measure
the genome-wide transcriptome of many individual cells in parallel, but results
in noisy data with many dropout events. Existing methods to learn molecular
signatures from bulk transcriptomic data may therefore not be adapted to
scRNA-seq data, in order to automatically classify individual cells into
predefined classes. We propose a new method called DropLasso to learn a
molecular signature from scRNA-seq data. DropLasso extends the dropout
regularisation technique, popular in neural network training, to esti- mate
sparse linear models. It is well adapted to data corrupted by dropout noise,
such as scRNA-seq data, and we clarify how it relates to elastic net
regularisation. We provide promising results on simulated and real scRNA-seq
data, suggesting that DropLasso may be better adapted than standard regularisa-
tions to infer molecular signatures from scRNA-seq data.

    <title>SMAGEXP: a galaxy tool suite for transcriptomics data meta-analysis</title>
    <summary>  Bakground: With the proliferation of available microarray and high throughput
sequencing experiments in the public domain, the use of meta-analysis methods
increases. In these experiments, where the sample size is often limited,
meta-analysis offers the possibility to considerably enhance the statistical
power and give more accurate results. For those purposes, it combines either
effect sizes or results of single studies in a appropriate manner. R packages
metaMA and metaRNASeq perform meta-analysis on microarray and NGS data,
respectively. They are not interchangeable as they rely on statistical modeling
specific to each technology.
  Results: SMAGEXP (Statistical Meta-Analysis for Gene EXPression) integrates
metaMA and metaRNAseq packages into Galaxy. We aim to propose a unified way to
carry out meta-analysis of gene expression data, while taking care of their
specificities. We have developed this tool suite to analyse microarray data
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database or custom data from affymetrix
microarrays. These data are then combined to carry out meta-analysis using
metaMA package. SMAGEXP also offers to combine raw read counts from Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments using DESeq2 and metaRNASeq package. In
both cases, key values, independent from the technology type, are reported to
judge the quality of the meta-analysis. These tools are available on the Galaxy
main tool shed. Source code, help and installation instructions are available
on github.
  Conclusion: The use of Galaxy offers an easy-to-use gene expression
meta-analysis tool suite based on the metaMA and metaRNASeq packages.

tied to edit distances on variations of a multi-graph called the breakpoint
graph. We study a weighted 2-break distance on Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graphs, which generalizes weighted versions of several Double Cut and
Join problems, including those on genomes with unequal gene content. We affirm
the connection between cycle decompositions and edit scenarios first discovered
with the Sorting By Reversals problem. Using this we show that the problem of
finding a parsimonious scenario of minimum cost on an Eulerian 2-edge-colored
multi-graph - with a general cost function for 2-breaks - can be solved by
decomposing the problem into independent instances on simple alternating
cycles. For breakpoint graphs, and a more constrained cost function, based on
coloring the vertices, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a
parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost, while showing that finding a
non-parsimonious 2-break scenario of minimum cost is NP-Hard.

    <title>TreeGrafter: phylogenetic tree-based annotation of proteins with Gene
  Ontology terms and other annotations</title>
    <summary>  Summary: TreeGrafter is a new software tool for annotating protein sequences
using annotated phylogenetic trees. Cur-rently, the tool provides annotations
to Gene Ontology terms, and PANTHER protein class, family and subfamily. The
ap-proach is generalizable to any annotations that have been made to internal
nodes of a reference phylogenetic tree. Tree-Grafter takes each input query
protein sequence, finds the best matching homologous family in a library of
pre-calculated, pre-annotated gene trees, and then grafts it to the best
location in the tree. It then annotates the sequence by propagating
anno-tations from its ancestral nodes in the reference tree. We show that
TreeGrafter outperforms subfamily HMM scoring for cor-rectly assigning
subfamily membership, and that it produces highly specific annotations of GO
terms based on annotated reference phylogenetic trees. This method will be
further inte-grated into InterProScan, enabling an even broader user
com-munity.

    <title>Automation of gene function prediction through modeling human curators'
  decisions in GO phylogenetic annotation project</title>
    <summary>  The Gene Ontology Consortium launched the GO-PAINT project (Phylogenetic
Annotation and INference Tool) 9 years ago and is currently being used in the
GO Reference Genome Annotation Project to support inference of GO function
terms (molecular function, cellular component and biological process) by
homology. PAINT uses a phylogenetic model to infer gene function by homology, a
process that requires manual curation of experienced biocurators. Tremendous
amount of time and efforts have been spent on the GO-PAINT project yielding
more than 4000 fully annotated phylogenetic families with more than 170,000
annotations. These preliminary data have thus enabled potential algorithmic
representation and automatic solvation of the additional 9000 unannoated
phylogenetic families. Here we present an automated pipeline for phylogenetic
annotation and inference, which simulates the standard annotation procedures of
curators and models the curators' decisions during the manual curation process.
The pipeline has been built into the newest version of PAINT software available
at http://www.pantherdb.org/downloads/index.jsp. The standalone automation
pipeline and datasets are available at
https://github.com/haimingt/GO-PAINT-automation

    <title>Predicting B Cell Receptor Substitution Profiles Using Public Repertoire
  Data</title>
    <summary>  B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity
maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity
maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same
"clonal family") are released from the germinal center, their amino acid
frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each
position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called "substitution
profiles", are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as
for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence
is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it
impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given
the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may
ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for
clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the
method "Substitution Profiles Using Related Families" (SPURF), a penalized
tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage
of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any
single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles
from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated
substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve
prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the
robustness of our approach on an external dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
command-line tool in an open-source software package
(https://github.com/krdav/SPURF) implementing these ideas and providing easy
prediction using our pre-fit models.

    <title>GOTaxon: Representing the evolution of biological functions in the Gene
  Ontology</title>
    <summary>  The Gene Ontology aims to define the universe of functions known for gene
products, at the molecular, cellular and organism levels. While the ontology is
designed to cover all aspects of biology in a "species independent manner", the
fact remains that many if not most biological functions are restricted in their
taxonomic range. This is simply because functions evolve, i.e. like other
biological characteristics they are gained and lost over evolutionary time.
Here we introduce a general method of representing the evolutionary gain and
loss of biological functions within the Gene Ontology. We then apply a variety
of techniques, including manual curation, logical reasoning over the ontology
structure, and previously published "taxon constraints" to assign evolutionary
gain and loss events to the majority of terms in the GO. These gain and loss
events now almost triple the number of terms with taxon constraints, and
currently cover a total of 76% of GO terms, including 40% of molecular function
terms, 78% of cellular component terms, and 89% of biological process terms.

    <title>Genomics as a Service: a Joint Computing and Networking Perspective</title>
    <summary>  This paper provides a global picture about the deployment of networked
processing services for genomic data sets. Many current research make an
extensive use genomic data, which are massive and rapidly increasing over time.
They are typically stored in remote databases, accessible by using Internet.
For this reason, a significant issue for effectively handling genomic data
through data networks consists of the available network services. A first
contribution of this paper consists of identifying the still unexploited
features of genomic data that could allow optimizing their networked
management. The second and main contribution of this survey consists of a
methodological classification of computing and networking alternatives which
can be used to offer what we call the Genomic-as-a-Service (GaaS) paradigm. In
more detail, we analyze the main genomic processing applications, and classify
not only the main computing alternatives to run genomics workflows in either a
local machine or a distributed cloud environment, but also the main software
technologies available to develop genomic processing services. Since an
analysis encompassing only the computing aspects would provide only a partial
view of the issues for deploying GaaS system, we present also the main
networking technologies that are available to efficiently support a GaaS
solution. We first focus on existing service platforms, and analyze them in
terms of service features, such as scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.
Then, we present a taxonomy for both wide area and datacenter network
technologies that may fit the GaaS requirements. It emerges that
virtualization, both in computing and networking, is the key for a successful
large-scale exploitation of genomic data, by pushing ahead the adoption of the
GaaS paradigm. Finally, the paper illustrates a short and long-term vision on
future research challenges in the field.

    <title>Learning differential module networks across multiple experimental
  conditions</title>
    <summary>  Module network inference is a statistical method to reconstruct gene
regulatory networks, which uses probabilistic graphical models to learn modules
of coregulated genes and their upstream regulatory programs from genome-wide
gene expression and other omics data. Here we review the basic theory of module
network inference, present protocols for common gene regulatory network
reconstruction scenarios based on the Lemon-Tree software, and show, using
human gene expression data, how the software can also be applied to learn
differential module networks across multiple experimental conditions.

    <title>Eight-cluster structure of chloroplast genomes differs from similar one
  observed for bacteria</title>
    <summary>  Previously, a seven-cluster pattern claiming to be a universal one in
bacterial genomes has been reported. Keeping in mind the most popular theory of
chloroplast origin, we checked whether a similar pattern is observed in
chloroplast genomes. Surprisingly, eight cluster structure has been found, for
chloroplasts. The pattern observed for chloroplasts differs rather
significantly, from bacterial one, and from that latter observed for
cyanobacteria. The structure is provided by clustering of the fragments of
equal length isolated within a genome so that each fragment is converted in
triplet frequency dictionary with non-overlapping triplets with no gaps in
frame tiling. The points in 63-dimensional space were clustered due to elastic
map technique. The eight cluster found in chloroplasts comprises the fragments
of a genome bearing tRNA genes and exhibiting excessively high
$\mathsf{GC}$-content, in comparison to the entire genome.

    <title>NGS Based Haplotype Assembly Using Matrix Completion</title>
    <summary>  We use matrix completion methods for haplotype assembly from NGS reads to
develop the new HapSVT, HapNuc, and HapOPT algorithms. This is performed by
applying a mathematical model to convert the reads to an incomplete matrix and
estimating unknown components. This is followed by quantizing and decoding the
completed matrix in order to generate haplotypes. These algorithms are compared
to the recently addressed SDhaP algorithm for the real fosmid data. It is shown
that reconstruction rate and the MSE of these algorithms outperform the SDhaP.
Also, the MEC score of the HapOPT is lower than that of the SDhaP with almost
the same running time.

    <title>Cluster-scaling, chaotic order and coherence in DNA</title>
    <summary>  Different numerical mappings of the DNA sequences have been studied using a
new cluster-scaling method and the well known spectral methods. It is shown, in
particular, that the nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules have robust
cluster-scaling properties. These properties are relevant to both types of
nucleotide pair-bases interactions: hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions.
It is shown that taking into account the cluster-scaling properties can help to
improve heterogeneous models of the DNA dynamics. It is also shown that a
chaotic (deterministic) order, rather than a stochastic randomness, controls
the energy minima positions of the stacking interactions in the DNA sequences
on large scales. The chaotic order results in a large-scale chaotic coherence
between the two complimentary DNA-duplex's sequences. A competition between
this broad-band chaotic coherence and the resonance coherence produced by
genetic code has been briefly discussed. The Arabidopsis plant genome (which is
a model plant for genome analysis) and two human genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, have
been considered as examples.

    <title>Graph Based Analysis for Gene Segment Organization In a Scrambled Genome</title>
    <summary>  DNA rearrangement processes recombine gene segments that are organized on the
chromosome in a variety of ways. The segments can overlap, interleave or one
may be a subsegment of another. We use directed graphs to represent segment
organizations on a given locus where contigs containing rearranged segments
represent vertices and the edges correspond to the segment relationships. Using
graph properties we associate a point in a higher dimensional Euclidean space
to each graph such that cluster formations and analysis can be performed with
methods from topological data analysis. The method is applied to a recently
sequenced model organism \textit{Oxytricha trifallax}, a species of ciliate
with highly scrambled genome that undergoes massive rearrangement process after
conjugation. The analysis shows some emerging star-like graph structures
indicating that segments of a single gene can interleave, or even contain all
of the segments from fifteen or more other genes in between its segments. We
also observe that as many as six genes can have their segments mutually
interleaving or overlapping.

    <title>Zinc oxide induces the stringent response and major reorientations in
  the central metabolism of Bacillus subtilis</title>
    <summary>  Microorganisms, such as bacteria, are one of the first targets of
nanoparticles in the environment. In this study, we tested the effect of two
nanoparticles, ZnO and TiO2, with the salt ZnSO4 as the control, on the
Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis by 2D gel electrophoresis-based
proteomics. Despite a significant effect on viability (LD50), TiO2 NPs had no
detectable effect on the proteomic pattern, while ZnO NPs and ZnSO4
significantly modified B. subtilis metabolism. These results allowed us to
conclude that the effects of ZnO observed in this work were mainly attributable
to Zn dissolution in the culture media. Proteomic analysis highlighted twelve
modulated proteins related to central metabolism: MetE and MccB (cysteine
metabolism), OdhA, AspB, IolD, AnsB, PdhB and YtsJ (Krebs cycle) and XylA,
YqjI, Drm and Tal (pentose phosphate pathway). Biochemical assays, such as free
sulfhydryl, CoA-SH and malate dehydrogenase assays corroborated the observed
central metabolism reorientation and showed that Zn stress induced oxidative
stress, probably as a consequence of thiol chelation stress by Zn ions. The
other patterns affected by ZnO and ZnSO4 were the stringent response and the
general stress response. Nine proteins involved in or controlled by the
stringent response showed a modified expression profile in the presence of ZnO
NPs or ZnSO4: YwaC, SigH, YtxH, YtzB, TufA, RplJ, RpsB, PdhB and Mbl. An
increase in the ppGpp concentration confirmed the involvement of the stringent
response during a Zn stress. All these metabolic reorientations in response to
Zn stress were probably the result of complex regulatory mechanisms including
at least the stringent response via YwaC.

    <title>Differential proteomics highlights macrophage-specific responses to
  amorphous silica nanoparticles</title>
    <summary>  The technological and economic benefits of engineered nanomaterials may be
offset by their adverse effects on living organisms. One of the highly produced
nanomaterials under such scrutiny is amorphous silica nanoparticles, which are
known to have an appreciable, although reversible, inflammatory potential. This
is due to their selective toxicity toward macrophages, and it is thus important
to study the cellular responses of this cell type to silica nanoparticles to
better understand the direct or indirect adverse effects of nanosilica. We have
here studied the responses of the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and of the
control MPC11 plasma cells to subtoxic concentrations of nanosilica, using a
combination of pro-teomic and targeted approaches. This allowed us to document
alterations in the cellular cytoskeleton, in the phagocytic capacity of the
cells as well as their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli. More
surprisingly, silica nanoparticles also induce a greater sensitivity of
macrophages to DNA alkylating agents, such as styrene oxide, even at doses
which do not induce any appreciable cell death.

    <title>Universal and idiosyncratic characteristic lengths in bacterial genomes</title>
    <summary>  In condensed matter physics, simplified descriptions are obtained by
coarse-graining the features of a system at a certain characteristic length,
defined as the typical length beyond which some properties are no longer
correlated. From a physics standpoint, in vitro DNA has thus a characteristic
length of 300 base pairs (bp), the Kuhn length of the molecule beyond which
correlations in its orientations are typically lost. From a biology standpoint,
in vivo DNA has a characteristic length of 1000 bp, the typical length of
genes. Since bacteria live in very different physico-chemical conditions and
since their genomes lack translational invariance, whether larger, universal
characteristic lengths exist is a non-trivial question. Here, we examine this
problem by leveraging the large number of fully sequenced genomes available in
public databases. By analyzing GC content correlations and the evolutionary
conservation of gene contexts (synteny) in hundreds of bacterial chromosomes,
we conclude that a fundamental characteristic length around 10-20 kb can be
defined. This characteristic length reflects elementary structures involved in
the coordination of gene expression, which are present all along the genome of
nearly all bacteria. Technically, reaching this conclusion required us to
implement methods that are insensitive to the presence of large idiosyncratic
genomic features, which may co-exist along these fundamental universal
structures.

    <title>SIMLR: A Tool for Large-Scale Genomic Analyses by Multi-Kernel Learning</title>
    <summary>  We here present SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning),
an open-source tool that implements a novel framework to learn a
sample-to-sample similarity measure from expression data observed for
heterogenous samples. SIMLR can be effectively used to perform tasks such as
dimension reduction, clustering, and visualization of heterogeneous populations
of samples. SIMLR was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods for these
three tasks on several public datasets, showing it to be scalable and capable
of greatly improving clustering performance, as well as providing valuable
insights by making the data more interpretable via better a visualization.
Availability and Implementation
  SIMLR is available on GitHub in both R and MATLAB implementations.
Furthermore, it is also available as an R package on http://bioconductor.org.

    <title>Variance Components Genetic Association Test for Zero-inflated Count
  Outcomes</title>
    <summary>  Commonly in biomedical research, studies collect data in which an outcome
measure contains informative excess zeros; for example when observing the
burden of neuritic plaques in brain pathology studies, those who show none
contribute to our understanding of neurodegenerative disease. The outcome may
be characterized by a mixture distribution with one component being the
`structural zero' and the other component being a Poisson distribution. We
propose a novel variance components score test of genetic association between a
set of genetic markers and a zero-inflated count outcome from a mixture
distribution. This test shares advantageous properties with SNP-set tests which
have been previously devised for standard continuous or binary outcomes, such
as the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT). In particular, our method has
superior statistical power compared to competing methods, especially when there
is correlation within the group of markers, and when the SNPs are associated
with both the mixing proportion and the rate of the Poisson distribution. We
apply the method to Alzheimer's data from the Rush University Religious Orders
Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), where as proof of principle we
find highly significant associations with the APOE gene, in both the
`structural zero' and `count' parameters, when applied to a zero-inflated
neuritic plaques count outcome.

    <title>A deep generative model for gene expression profiles from single-cell
  RNA sequencing</title>
    <summary>  We propose a probabilistic model for interpreting gene expression levels that
are observed through single-cell RNA sequencing. In the model, each cell has a
low-dimensional latent representation. Additional latent variables account for
technical effects that may erroneously set some observations of gene expression
levels to zero. Conditional distributions are specified by neural networks,
giving the proposed model enough flexibility to fit the data well. We use
variational inference and stochastic optimization to approximate the posterior
distribution. The inference procedure scales to over one million cells, whereas
competing algorithms do not. Even for smaller datasets, for several tasks, the
proposed procedure outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ZIFA and
ZINB-WaVE. We also extend our framework to account for batch effects and other
confounding factors, and propose a Bayesian hypothesis test for differential
expression that outperforms DESeq2.

    <title>GIFT: Guided and Interpretable Factorization for Tensors - An
  Application to Large-Scale Multi-platform Cancer Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Given multi-platform genome data with prior knowledge of functional gene
sets, how can we extract interpretable latent relationships between patients
and genes? More specifically, how can we devise a tensor factorization method
which produces an interpretable gene factor matrix based on gene set
information while maintaining the decomposition quality and speed? We propose
GIFT, a Guided and Interpretable Factorization for Tensors. GIFT provides
interpretable factor matrices by encoding prior knowledge as a regularization
term in its objective function. Experiment results demonstrate that GIFT
produces interpretable factorizations with high scalability and accuracy, while
other methods lack interpretability. We apply GIFT to the PanCan12 dataset, and
GIFT reveals significant relations between cancers, gene sets, and genes, such
as influential gene sets for specific cancer (e.g., interferon-gamma response
gene set for ovarian cancer) or relations between cancers and genes (e.g., BRCA
cancer - APOA1 gene and OV, UCEC cancers - BST2 gene).

    <title>Generalized Similarity U: A Non-parametric Test of Association Based on
  Similarity</title>
    <summary>  Second generation sequencing technologies are being increasingly used for
genetic association studies, where the main research interest is to identify
sets of genetic variants that contribute to various phenotype. The phenotype
can be univariate disease status, multivariate responses and even
high-dimensional outcomes. Considering the genotype and phenotype as two
complex objects, this also poses a general statistical problem of testing
association between complex objects. We here proposed a similarity-based test,
generalized similarity U (GSU), that can test the association between complex
objects. We first studied the theoretical properties of the test in a general
setting and then focused on the application of the test to sequencing
association studies. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed to use
Laplacian kernel based similarity for GSU to boost power and enhance
robustness. Through simulation, we found that GSU did have advantages over
existing methods in terms of power and robustness. We further performed a whole
genome sequencing (WGS) scan for Alzherimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) data, identifying three genes, APOE, APOC1 and TOMM40, associated with
imaging phenotype. We developed a C++ package for analysis of whole genome
sequencing data using GSU. The source codes can be downloaded at

    <title>Modeling Biological Problems in Computer Science: A Case Study in Genome
  Assembly</title>
    <summary>  As computer scientists working in bioinformatics/computational biology, we
often face the challenge of coming up with an algorithm to answer a biological
question. This occurs in many areas, such as variant calling, alignment, and
assembly. In this tutorial, we use the example of the genome assembly problem
to demonstrate how to go from a question in the biological realm to a solution
in the computer science realm. We show the modeling process step-by-step,
including all the intermediate failed attempts.

    <title>Detecting Epistatic Selection with Partially Observed Genotype Data
  Using Copula Graphical Models</title>
    <summary>  Recombinant Inbred Lines derived from divergent parental lines can display
extensive segregation distortion and long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD)
between distant loci. These genomic signatures are consistent with epistatic
selection during inbreeding. Epistatic interactions affect growth and fertility
traits or even cause complete lethality. Detecting epistasis is challenging as
multiple testing approaches are under-powered and true long-range LD is
difficult to distinguish from drift.
  Here we develop a method for reconstructing an underlying network of genomic
signatures of high-dimensional epistatic selection from multi-locus genotype
data. The network captures the conditionally dependent short- and long-range LD
structure and thus reveals "aberrant" marker-marker associations that are due
to epistatic selection rather than gametic linkage. The network estimation
relies on penalized Gaussian copula graphical models, which accounts for a
large number of markers p and a small number of individuals n.
  A multi-core implementation of our algorithm makes it feasible to estimate
the graph in high-dimensions also in the presence of significant portions of
missing data. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on simulated
datasets as well as on genotyping data in A.thaliana and maize. In addition, we
implemented the method in the R package netgwas which is freely available at
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=netgwas.

    <title>High Speed All-optical extended DV-Curve-based DNA sequence alignment
  utilizing wavelength and polarization modulation</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a novel optical processing approach for exploring genome
sequences built upon optical correlator for global alignment and extended
DV-curve method for local alignment. To overcome the problem of traditional
DV-curve method for presenting an accurate and simplified output, we propose
HAWPOD, built upon DV- curve method, to analyze genome sequences in five steps:
DNA coding, alignment, noise cancellation, simplification, and modification.
Moreover, all-optical implementation of the HAWPOD method is developed, while
its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations in LUMERICAL FDTD. The
results express the proposed method is much faster than its electrical
counterparts, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tools.

    <title>Iterative Random Forests to detect predictive and stable high-order
  interactions</title>
    <summary>  Genomics has revolutionized biology, enabling the interrogation of whole
transcriptomes, genome-wide binding sites for proteins, and many other
molecular processes. However, individual genomic assays measure elements that
interact in vivo as components of larger molecular machines. Understanding how
these high-order interactions drive gene expression presents a substantial
statistical challenge. Building on Random Forests (RF), Random Intersection
Trees (RITs), and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we
developed the iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a
feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order
interactions with same order of computational cost as RF. We demonstrate the
utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems:
enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of
primary transcripts in human derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20
pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned
in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80% have been previously reported
as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g.
between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order
relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived
cells, iRF re-discovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated
splicing regulation, and identified novel 5th and 6th order interactions,
indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing
regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost
of identification, iRF opens new avenues of inquiry into the molecular
mechanisms underlying genome biology.

    <title>Two-Tier Mapper: a user-independent clustering method for global gene
  expression analysis based on topology</title>
    <summary>  There is a growing need for unbiased clustering methods, ideally automated.
We have developed a topology-based analysis tool called Two-Tier Mapper (TTMap)
to detect subgroups in global gene expression datasets and identify their
distinguishing features. First, TTMap discerns and adjusts for highly variable
features in the control group and identifies outliers. Second, the deviation of
each test sample from the control group in a high-dimensional space is computed
and the test samples are clustered in a global and local network using a new
topological algorithm based on Mapper. Validation of TTMap on both synthetic
and biological datasets shows that it outperforms current clustering methods in
sensitivity and stability; clustering is not affected by removal of samples
from the control group, choice of normalization nor subselection of data. There
is no user induced bias because all parameters are data-driven. Datasets can
readily be combined into one analysis. TTMap reveals hitherto undetected gene
expression changes in mouse mammary glands related to hormonal changes during
the estrous cycle. This illustrates the ability to extract information from
highly variable biological samples and its potential for personalized medicine.

    <title>Fast permutation tests and related methods, for association between rare
  variants and binary outcomes</title>
    <summary>  In large scale genetic association studies, a primary aim is to test for
association between genetic variants and a disease outcome. The variants of
interest are often rare, and appear with low frequency among subjects. In this
situation, statistical tests based on standard asymptotic results do not
adequately control the Type I error rate, especially if the case:control ratio
is unbalanced. In this paper, we propose the use of permutation and approximate
unconditional tests for testing association with rare variants. We use novel
analytical calculations to efficiently approximate the true Type I error rate
under common study designs, and in numerical studies show that the proposed
classes of tests significantly improve upon standard testing methods. We also
illustrate our methods in data from a recent case-control study, for genetic
causes of a severe side-effect of a common drug treatment.

    <title>Generating and designing DNA with deep generative models</title>
    <summary>  We propose generative neural network methods to generate DNA sequences and
tune them to have desired properties. We present three approaches: creating
synthetic DNA sequences using a generative adversarial network; a DNA-based
variant of the activation maximization ("deep dream") design method; and a
joint procedure which combines these two approaches together. We show that
these tools capture important structures of the data and, when applied to
designing probes for protein binding microarrays, allow us to generate new
sequences whose properties are estimated to be superior to those found in the
training data. We believe that these results open the door for applying deep
generative models to advance genomics research.

    <title>A machine learning approach to drug repositioning based on drug
  expression profiles: Applications to schizophrenia and depression/anxiety
  disorders</title>
    <summary>  Development of new medications is a very lengthy and costly process. Finding
novel indications for existing drugs, or drug repositioning, can serve as a
useful strategy to shorten the development cycle. In this study, we present an
approach to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a
particular disease based on expression profiles of drugs, with a focus on
applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the
disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as good candidates for
repurposing. This framework is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with
expression profiles measured, even if the drug targets are unknown. It is also
highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We
applied this approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia
as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches for prediction, including
deep neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), elastic net, random forest
and gradient boosted machines. The performance of the five approaches did not
differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperformed the others. However,
methods with lower predictive accuracy can still reveal literature-supported
candidates that are of different mechanisms of actions. As a further
validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric
medications considered in clinical trials. Notably, many top repositioning hits
are supported by previous preclinical or clinical studies. Finally, we propose
that ML approaches may provide a new avenue to explore drug mechanisms via
examining the variable importance of gene features.

    <title>Attention based convolutional neural network for predicting RNA-protein
  binding sites</title>
    <summary>  RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in many biological processes,
e.g. gene regulation. Computational identification of RBP binding sites on RNAs
are urgently needed. In particular, RBPs bind to RNAs by recognizing sequence
motifs. Thus, fast locating those motifs on RNA sequences is crucial and
time-efficient for determining whether the RNAs interact with the RBPs or not.
In this study, we present an attention based convolutional neural network,
iDeepA, to predict RNA-protein binding sites from raw RNA sequences. We first
encode RNA sequences into one-hot encoding. Next, we design a deep learning
model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism,
which automatically search for important positions, e.g. binding motifs, to
learn discriminant high-level features for predicting RBP binding sites. We
evaluate iDeepA on publicly gold-standard RBP binding sites derived from
CLIP-seq data. The results demonstrate iDeepA achieves comparable performance
with other state-of-the-art methods.

    <title>DCJVis: visualization of genome rearrangements using DCJ operations</title>
    <summary>  The {\em double-cut-and-join} (DCJ) operation, introduced by Yancopoulos
\emph{et al.}, allows minimum edit distance to be computed by modeling all
possible classical rearrangement operations, such as inversions, fusions,
fissions, translocations, and transpositions, in linear-time between two
genomes. However, there is lack of visualization tool that can effectively
present DCJ operations that will help biologists to use DCJ operation. In this
paper, a new visualization program is introduced, DCJVis, to create a diagram
of each DCJ operation necessary to transform between the genomes of two
distinct organisms by describing a possible sequence of genome graphs based on
the selected gene adjacency on the source genome for the DCJ operation. Our
program is the first visualization tool for DCJ operations using circular
layout. Specifically, the genomes of \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and
\textit{Candida albicans} are used to demonstrate the functionality of this
program and provide an example of the type of problem this program can solve
for biologists.

    <title>Exploring shared genetic bases and causal relationships of schizophrenia
  and bipolar disorder with 28 cardiovascular and metabolic traits</title>
    <summary>  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent a major health issue in patients with
schizophrneia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but the exact nature of
cardiometabolic (CM) abnormalities involved and the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and LD score regression, we
investigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with a panel of 28
cardiometabolic traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate
casual relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was
based on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
We also identified the potential shared genetic variants by a statistical
approach based on local true discovery rates, and inferred the pathways
involved. We found polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism
abnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased wait-hip ratio and raised
visceral adiposity. However, BMI showed inverse genetic correlation and
polygenic link with SCZ. On the other hand, we observed polygenic associations
with an overall favorable CM profile in BD. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be
causally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be
linked to BD; otherwise MR did not reveal other significant causal
relationships in general. We also identified numerous SNPs and pathways shared
between SCZ/BD with cardiometabolic traits, some of which are related to
inflammation or the immune system. In conclusion, SCZ patients may be
genetically associated with several CM abnormalities independent of medication
side-effects, and proper surveillance and management of CV risk factors may be
required from the onset of the disease. On the other hand, CM abnormalities in
BD are more likely to be secondary.

    <title>Ococo: an online consensus caller</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The usual approach to variant calling from NGS data consists in
inferring single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or more complex differences from
read alignments. Consequently, variant calling is performed after all reads
have been mapped to a reference genome and all read alignments are available.
Existing variant callers usually operate by first sorting the alignments in
increasing order of positions, and then sliding a small window through the
genome and processing information collected within individual windows (read
alignments, mapping qualities, base qualities). However, this approach is
highly time- and space-demanding and all alignments must be available prior to
variant calling.
  Results: We present OCOCO, the first online consensus caller, capable to
infer SNVs dynamically as read alignments are fed in. OCOCO inputs unsorted
alignments from an unsorted SAM/BAM stream and decides about single-nucleotide
updates of the current genomic consensus using statistics stored in compact
several-bits counters. Updates are reported in the online fashion using
unsorted VCF. OCOCO provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to the
usual variant calling, particularly advantageous when reads are sequenced or
mapped progressively, or when available computational resources are at a
premium.
  Availability and implementation: OCOCO is available from
http://github.com/karel- brinda/ococo.

    <title>MSIQ: Joint Modeling of Multiple RNA-seq Samples for Accurate Isoform
  Quantification</title>
    <summary>  Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has been widely used to
assess full-length RNA isoform abundance in a high-throughput manner. RNA-seq
data offer insight into gene expression levels and transcriptome structures,
enabling us to better understand the regulation of gene expression and
fundamental biological processes. Accurate isoform quantification from RNA-seq
data is challenging due to the information loss in sequencing experiments. A
recent accumulation of multiple RNA-seq data sets from the same tissue or cell
type provides new opportunities to improve the accuracy of isoform
quantification. However, existing statistical or computational methods for
multiple RNA-seq samples either pool the samples into one sample or assign
equal weights to the samples when estimating isoform abundance. These methods
ignore the possible heterogeneity in the quality of different samples and could
result in biased and unrobust estimates. In this article, we develop a method,
which we call "joint modeling of multiple RNA-seq samples for accurate isoform
quantification" (MSIQ), for more accurate and robust isoform quantification by
integrating multiple RNA-seq samples under a Bayesian framework. Our method
aims to (1) identify a consistent group of samples with homogeneous quality and
(2) improve isoform quantification accuracy by jointly modeling multiple
RNA-seq samples by allowing for higher weights on the consistent group. We show
that MSIQ provides a consistent estimator of isoform abundance, and we
demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of MSIQ compared with alternative
methods through simulation studies on D. melanogaster genes. We justify MSIQ's
advantages over existing approaches via application studies on real RNA-seq
data from human embryonic stem cells, brain tissues, and the HepG2 immortalized
cell line.

    <title>Trans-allelic model for prediction of peptide:MHC-II interactions</title>
    <summary>  Major histocompatibility complex class two (MHC-II) molecules are
trans-membrane proteins and key components of the cellular immune system. Upon
recognition of foreign peptides expressed on the MHC-II binding groove, helper
T cells mount an immune response against invading pathogens. Therefore,
mechanistic identification and knowledge of physico-chemical features that
govern interactions between peptides and MHC-II molecules is useful for the
design of effective epitope-based vaccines, as well as for understanding of
immune responses. In this paper, we present a comprehensive trans-allelic
prediction model, a generalized version of our previous biophysical model, that
can predict peptide interactions for all three human MHC-II loci (HLA-DR,
HLA-DP and HLA-DQ), using both peptide sequence data and structural information
of MHC-II molecules. The advantage of this approach over other machine learning
models is that it offers a simple and plausible physical explanation for
peptide-MHC-II interactions. We train the model using a benchmark experimental
dataset, and measure its predictive performance using novel data. Despite its
relative simplicity, we find that the model has comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art method. Focusing on the physical bases of peptide-MHC binding,
we find support for previous theoretical predictions about the contributions of
certain binding pockets to the binding energy. Additionally, we find that
binding pockets P 4 and P 5 of HLA-DP, which were not previously considered as
primary anchors, do make strong contributions to the binding energy. Together,
the results indicate that our model can serve as a useful complement to
alternative approaches to predicting peptide-MHC interactions.

    <title>Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks for Effective Translation
  Initiation Site Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Thanks to rapidly evolving sequencing techniques, the amount of genomic data
at our disposal is growing increasingly large. Determining the gene structure
is a fundamental requirement to effectively interpret gene function and
regulation. An important part in that determination process is the
identification of translation initiation sites. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for automatic prediction of translation initiation sites,
leveraging convolutional neural networks that allow for automatic feature
extraction. Our experimental results demonstrate that we are able to improve
the state-of-the-art approaches with a decrease of 75.2% in false positive rate
and with a decrease of 24.5% in error rate on chosen datasets. Furthermore, an
in-depth analysis of the decision-making process used by our predictive model
shows that our neural network implicitly learns biologically relevant features
from scratch, without any prior knowledge about the problem at hand, such as
the Kozak consensus sequence, the influence of stop and start codons in the
sequence and the presence of donor splice site patterns. In summary, our
findings yield a better understanding of the internal reasoning of a
convolutional neural network when applying such a neural network to genomic
data.

    <title>Applications and Challenges of Real-time Mobile DNA Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The DNA sequencing is the process of identifying the exact order of
nucleotides within a given DNA molecule. The new portable and relatively
inexpensive DNA sequencers, such as Oxford Nanopore MinION, have the potential
to move DNA sequencing outside of laboratory, leading to faster and more
accessible DNA-based diagnostics. However, portable DNA sequencing and analysis
are challenging for mobile systems, owing to high data throughputs and
computationally intensive processing performed in environments with unreliable
connectivity and power.
  In this paper, we provide an analysis of the challenges that mobile systems
and mobile computing must address to maximize the potential of portable DNA
sequencing, and in situ DNA analysis. We explain the DNA sequencing process and
highlight the main differences between traditional and portable DNA sequencing
in the context of the actual and envisioned applications. We look at the
identified challenges from the perspective of both algorithms and systems
design, showing the need for careful co-design.

    <title>Fast ordered sampling of DNA sequence variants</title>
    <summary>  Explosive growth in the amount of genomic data is matched by increasing power
of consumer-grade computers. Even applications that require powerful servers
can be quickly tested on desktop or laptop machines if we can generate
representative samples from large data sets. I describe a fast and
memory-efficient implementation of an on-line sampling method developed for
tape drives 30 years ago. Focusing on genotype files, I test the performance of
this technique on modern solid-state and spinning hard drives, and show that it
performs well compared to a simple sampling scheme. I illustrate its utility by
developing a method to quickly estimate genome-wide patterns of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) decay with distance. I provide open-source software that
samples loci from several variant format files, a separate program that
performs LD decay estimates, and a C++ library that lets developers incorporate
these methods into their own projects.

    <title>Extending species-area relationships (SAR) to diversity-area
  relationships (DAR)</title>
    <summary>  I extend the traditional SAR, which has achieved status of ecological law and
plays a critical role in global biodiversity assessment, to the general (alpha-
or beta-diversity in Hill numbers) diversity area relationship (DAR). The
extension was motivated to remedy the limitation of traditional SAR that only
address one aspect of biodiversity scaling, i.e., species richness scaling over
space. The extension was made possible by the fact that all Hill numbers are in
units of species (referred to as the effective number of species or as species
equivalents), and I postulated that Hill numbers should follow the same or
similar pattern of SAR. I selected three DAR models, the traditional power law
(PL), PLEC (PL with exponential cutoff) and PLIEC (PL with inverse exponential
cutoff). I defined three new concepts and derived their quantifications: (i)DAR
profile: z-q series where z is the PL scaling parameter at different diversity
order (q); (ii)PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap) profile: g-q series where g is
the PDO corresponding to q; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile:
Dmax-q series where Dmax is the MAD corresponding to q. Furthermore, the PDO-g
is quantified based on the self-similarity property of the PL model, and Dmax
can be estimated from the PLEC parameters. The three profiles constitute a
novel DAR approach to biodiversity scaling. I verified the postulation with the
American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1473 healthy North American
individuals (the largest human dataset from a single project to date). The PL
model was preferred due to its simplicity and established ecological properties
such as self-similarity (necessary for establishing PDO profile), and PLEC has
an advantage in establishing the MAD profile. All three profiles for the AGP
dataset were successfully quantified and compared with existing SAR parameters
in the literature whenever possible.

    <title>Evaluating deep variational autoencoders trained on pan-cancer gene
  expression</title>
    <summary>  Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with diverse molecular etiologies and
outcomes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has released a large compendium of
over 10,000 tumors with RNA-seq gene expression measurements. Gene expression
captures the diverse molecular profiles of tumors and can be interrogated to
reveal differential pathway activations. Deep unsupervised models, including
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) can be used to reveal these underlying patterns.
We compare a one-hidden layer VAE to two alternative VAE architectures with
increased depth. We determine the additional capacity marginally improves
performance. We train and compare the three VAE architectures to other
dimensionality reduction techniques including principal components analysis
(PCA), independent components analysis (ICA), non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF), and analysis of gene expression by denoising autoencoders (ADAGE). We
compare performance in a supervised learning task predicting gene inactivation
pan-cancer and in a latent space analysis of high grade serous ovarian cancer
(HGSC) subtypes. We do not observe substantial differences across algorithms in
the classification task. VAE latent spaces offer biological insights into HGSC
subtype biology.

    <title>A Sparse Graph-Structured Lasso Mixed Model for Genetic Association with
  Confounding Correction</title>
    <summary>  While linear mixed model (LMM) has shown a competitive performance in
correcting spurious associations raised by population stratification, family
structures, and cryptic relatedness, more challenges are still to be addressed
regarding the complex structure of genotypic and phenotypic data. For example,
geneticists have discovered that some clusters of phenotypes are more
co-expressed than others. Hence, a joint analysis that can utilize such
relatedness information in a heterogeneous data set is crucial for genetic
modeling.
  We proposed the sparse graph-structured linear mixed model (sGLMM) that can
incorporate the relatedness information from traits in a dataset with
confounding correction. Our method is capable of uncovering the genetic
associations of a large number of phenotypes together while considering the
relatedness of these phenotypes. Through extensive simulation experiments, we
show that the proposed model outperforms other existing approaches and can
model correlation from both population structure and shared signals. Further,
we validate the effectiveness of sGLMM in the real-world genomic dataset on two
different species from plants and humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana data, sGLMM
behaves better than all other baseline models for 63.4% traits. We also discuss
the potential causal genetic variation of Human Alzheimer's disease discovered
by our model and justify some of the most important genetic loci.

    <title>Meraculous2: fast accurate short-read assembly of large polymorphic
  genomes</title>
    <summary>  We present Meraculous2, an update to the Meraculous short-read assembler that
includes (1) handling of allelic variation using "bubble" structures within the
de Bruijn graph, (2) improved gap closing, and (3) an improved scaffolding
algorithm that produces more complete assemblies without compromising
scaffolding accuracy. The speed and bandwidth efficiency of the new parallel
implementation have also been substantially improved, allowing the assembly of
a human genome to be accomplished in 24 hours on the JGI/NERSC Genepool system.
To highlight the features of Meraculous2 we present here the assembly of the
diploid human genome NA12878, and compare it with previously published
assemblies of the same data using other algorithms. The Meraculous2 assemblies
are shown to have better completeness, contiguity, and accuracy than other
published assemblies for these data. Practical considerations including
pre-assembly analyses of polymorphism and repetitiveness are described.

    <title>Inverse statistical problems: from the inverse Ising problem to data
  science</title>
    <summary>  Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of
`big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in
biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs
to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model
parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In
this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related
problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given
observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review
applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of
neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene
regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of
controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the
statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method,
pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising
problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be
reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.

    <title>Comprehensive overview and assessment of miRNA target prediction tools
  in human and drosophila melanogaster</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level through complementary base pairing with the
target mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation and blocking translation process. Any
dysfunctions of these small regulatory molecules have been linked with the
development and progression of several diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to
reliably predict potential miRNA targets. A large number of computational
prediction tools have been developed which provide a faster way to find
putative miRNA targets, but at the same time their results are often
inconsistent. Hence, finding a reliable, functional miRNA target is still a
challenging task. Also, each tool is equipped with different algorithms, and it
is difficult for the biologists to know which tool is the best choice for their
study. This paper briefly describes fundamental of miRNA target prediction
algorithms, discuss frequently used prediction tools, and further, the
performance of frequently used prediction tools have been assessed using
experimentally validated high confident mature miRNAs and their targets for two
organisms Human and Drosophila Melanogaster. Both Drosophila Melanogaster and
Human supported miRNA target prediction tools have been evaluated separately to
find out best performing tool for each of these two organisms. In the human
dataset, TargetScan showed the best results amongst the other predictors
followed by the miRmap and microT, whereas in the D. Melanogaster dataset,
MicroT tool showed the best performance followed by the TargetScan in the
comparison of other tools.

onto a reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor.
State-of-the-art read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations
for seeds (i.e., smaller segments) within each read, 2) extract reference
sequences at each of the mapping locations, and 3) check similarity between
each read and its associated reference sequences with a
computationally-expensive algorithm (i.e., sequence alignment) to determine the
origin of the read. A seed location filter comes into play before alignment,
discarding seed locations that alignment would deem a poor match. The ideal
seed location filter would discard all poor match locations prior to alignment
such that there is no wasted computation on unnecessary alignments.
  Results: We propose a novel seed location filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter,
optimized to exploit 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation
within a logic layer stacked under memory layers, to perform
processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters seed locations by 1)
introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference
genome, and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read
presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for a
sequence alignment error tolerance of 0.05, GRIM-Filter 1) reduces the false
negative rate of filtering by 5.59x--6.41x, and 2) provides an end-to-end read
mapper speedup of 1.81x--3.65x, compared to a state-of-the-art read mapper
employing the best previous seed location filtering algorithm.

    <title>MetaHMM: A Webserver for Identifying Novel Genes with Specified
  Functions in Metagenomic Samples</title>
    <summary>  The fast and affordable sequencing of large clinical and environmental
metagenomic datasets opens up new horizons in medical and biotechnological
applications. It is believed that today we have described only about 1\% of the
microorganisms on the Earth, therefore, metagenomic analysis mostly deals with
unknown species in the samples. Microbial communities in extreme environments
may contain genes with high biotechnological potential, and clinical
metagenomes, related to diseases, may uncover still unknown pathogens and
pathological mechanisms in known diseases. While the species-level
identification and description of the taxa in the samples does not seem to be
possible today, we can search for novel genes with known functions in these
samples, using numerous techniques, including artificial intelligence tools,
like the hidden Markov models (HMMs). Here we describe a simple-to-use
webserver, the MetaHMM, which is capable of homology-based automatic
model-building for the genes to be searched for, and it also finds the closest
matches in the metagenome. The webserver uses already highly successful
building blocks: it performs multiple alignment by applying Clustal Omega,
builds a hidden Markov model with HMMER components of hmmbuild and uses
hmmsearch for finding similar sequences to the specified model in the
metagenomes. The webserver is publicly available at
\url{https://metahmm.pitgroup.org}.

    <title>Implicit Causal Models for Genome-wide Association Studies</title>
    <summary>  Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing
richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable
algorithms for their Bayesian inference. However, there has been limited
progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how
individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus
on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which
can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple
causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables
influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal
relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality
and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal
models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an
implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that
adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we
scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve
state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly
outperform existing genetics methods by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.

    <title>Using a hydrogen-bond index to predict the gene-silencing efficiency of
  siRNA based on the local structure of mRNA</title>
    <summary>  The gene silencing effect of short interfering RNA (siRNA) is known to vary
strongly with the targeted position of the mRNA. A number of hypotheses have
been suggested to explain this phenomenon. We would like to test if this
positional effect is mainly due to the secondary structure of the mRNA at the
target site. We proposed that this structural factor can be characterized by a
single parameter called "the hydrogen bond (H-b) index", which represents the
average number of hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotides in the target
region and the rest of the mRNA. This index can be determined using a
computational approach. We tested the correlation between the H-b index and the
gene-silencing effects on three genes (Bcl-2, hTF and cyclin B1) using a
variety of siRNAs. We found that the gene-silencing effect is inversely
dependent on the H-b index, indicating that the local mRNA structure at the
targeted site is the main cause of the positional effect. Based on this
finding, we suggest that the H-b index can be a useful guideline for future
siRNA design.

    <title>LSMM: A statistical approach to integrating functional annotations with
  genome-wide association studies</title>
    <summary>  Thousands of risk variants underlying complex phenotypes (quantitative traits
and diseases) have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
However, there are still two major challenges towards deepening our
understanding of the genetic architectures of complex phenotypes. First, the
majority of GWAS hits are in the non-coding region and their biological
interpretation is still unclear. Second, accumulating evidence from GWAS
suggests the polygenicity of complex traits, i.e., a complex trait is often
affected by many variants with small or moderate effects, whereas a large
proportion of risk variants with small effects remains unknown. The
availability of functional annotation data enables us to address the above
challenges. In this study, we propose a latent sparse mixed model (LSMM) to
integrate functional annotations with GWAS data. Not only does it increase
statistical power of the identification of risk variants, but also offers more
biological insights by detecting relevant functional annotations. To allow LSMM
scalable to millions of variants and hundreds of functional annotations, we
developed an efficient variational expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for
model parameter estimation and statistical inference. We first conducted
comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of LSMM. Then we
applied it to analyze 30 GWAS of complex phenotypes integrated with 9 genic
category annotations and 127 tissue-specific functional annotations from the
Roadmap project. The results demonstrate that our method possesses more
statistical power over conventional methods, and can help researchers achieve
deeper understanding of genetic architecture of these complex phenotypes.

    <title>Feature versus Raw Sequence: Deep Learning Comparative Study on
  Predicting Pre-miRNA</title>
    <summary>  Should we input known genome sequence features or input sequence itself in
deep learning framework? As deep learning more popular in various applications,
researchers often come to question whether to generate features or use raw
sequences for deep learning. To answer this question, we study the prediction
accuracy of precursor miRNA prediction of feature-based deep belief network and
sequence-based convolution neural network. Tested on a variant of six-layer
convolution neural net and three-layer deep belief network, we find the raw
sequence input based convolution neural network model performs similar or
slightly better than feature based deep belief networks with best accuracy
values of 0.995 and 0.990, respectively. Both the models outperform existing
benchmarks models. The results shows us that if provided large enough data,
well devised raw sequence based deep learning models can replace feature based
deep learning models. However, construction of well behaved deep learning model
can be very challenging. In cased features can be easily extracted,
feature-based deep learning models may be a better alternative.

    <title>A deep generative model for single-cell RNA sequencing with application
  to detecting differentially expressed genes</title>
    <summary>  We propose a probabilistic model for interpreting gene expression levels that
are observed through single-cell RNA sequencing. In the model, each cell has a
low-dimensional latent representation. Additional latent variables account for
technical effects that may erroneously set some observations of gene expression
levels to zero. Conditional distributions are specified by neural networks,
giving the proposed model enough flexibility to fit the data well. We use
variational inference and stochastic optimization to approximate the posterior
distribution. The inference procedure scales to over one million cells, whereas
competing algorithms do not. Even for smaller datasets, for several tasks, the
proposed procedure outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ZIFA and
ZINB-WaVE. We also extend our framework to take into account batch effects and
other confounding factors and propose a natural Bayesian hypothesis framework
for differential expression that outperforms tradition DESeq2.

    <title>Multi-Kernel LS-SVM Based Bio-Clinical Data Integration: Applications to
  Ovarian Cancer</title>
    <summary>  The medical research facilitates to acquire a diverse type of data from the
same individual for particular cancer. Recent studies show that utilizing such
diverse data results in more accurate predictions. The major challenge faced is
how to utilize such diverse data sets in an effective way. In this paper, we
introduce a multiple kernel based pipeline for integrative analysis of
high-throughput molecular data (somatic mutation, copy number alteration, DNA
methylation and mRNA) and clinical data. We apply the pipeline on Ovarian
cancer data from TCGA. After multiple kernels have been generated from the
weighted sum of individual kernels, it is used to stratify patients and predict
clinical outcomes. We examine the survival time, vital status, and neoplasm
cancer status of each subtype to verify how well they cluster. We have also
examined the power of molecular and clinical data in predicting dichotomized
overall survival data and to classify the tumor grade for the cancer samples.
It was observed that the integration of various data types yields higher
log-rank statistics value. We were also able to predict clinical status with
higher accuracy as compared to using individual data types.

    <title>Prior Knowledge based mutation prioritization towards causal variant
  finding in rare disease</title>
    <summary>  How do we determine the mutational effects in exome sequencing data with
little or no statistical evidence? Can protein structural information fill in
the gap of not having enough statistical evidence? In this work, we answer the
two questions with the goal towards determining pathogenic effects of rare
variants in rare disease. We take the approach of determining the importance of
point mutation loci focusing on protein structure features. The proposed
structure-based features contain information about geometric, physicochemical,
and functional information of mutation loci and those of structural neighbors
of the loci. The performance of the structure-based features trained on 80\% of
HumDiv and tested on 20\% of HumDiv and on ClinVar datasets showed high levels
of discernibility in the mutation's pathogenic or benign effects: F score of
0.71 and 0.68 respectively using multi-layer perceptron. Combining structure-
and sequence-based feature further improve the accuracy: F score of 0.86
(HumDiv) and 0.75 (ClinVar). Also, careful examination of the rare variants in
rare diseases cases showed that structure-based features are important in
discerning importance of variant loci.

    <title>An Extension of Deep Pathway Analysis: A Pathway Route Analysis
  Framework Incorporating Multi-dimensional Cancer Genomics Data</title>
    <summary>  Recent breakthroughs in cancer research have come via the up-and-coming field
of pathway analysis. By applying statistical methods to prior known gene and
protein regulatory information, pathway analysis provides a meaningful way to
interpret genomic data. While many gene/protein regulatory relationships have
been studied, never before has such a significant amount data been made
available in organized forms of gene/protein regulatory networks and pathways.
However, pathway analysis research is still in its infancy, especially when
applying it to solve practical problems.
  In this paper we propose a new method of studying biological pathways, one
that cross analyzes mutation information, transcriptome and proteomics data.
Using this outcome, we identify routes of aberrant pathways potentially
responsible for the etiology of disease. Each pathway route is encoded as a
bayesian network which is initialized with a sequence of conditional
probabilities specifically designed to encode directionality of regulatory
relationships encoded in the pathways. Far more complex interactions, such as
phosphorylation and methylation, among others, in the pathways can be modeled
using this approach. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through its
ability to distinguish real pathways from decoys on TCGA mRNA-seq, mutation,
Copy Number Variation and phosphorylation data for both Breast cancer and
Ovarian cancer study. The majority of pathways distinguished can be confirmed
by biological literature. Moreover, the proportion of correctly indentified
pathways is \% higher than previous work where only mRNA-seq mutation data is
incorporated for breast cancer patients. Consequently, such an in-depth pathway
analysis incorporating more diverse data can give rise to the accuracy of
perturbed pathway detection.

    <title>Dilated Convolutions for Modeling Long-Distance Genomic Dependencies</title>
    <summary>  We consider the task of detecting regulatory elements in the human genome
directly from raw DNA. Past work has focused on small snippets of DNA, making
it difficult to model long-distance dependencies that arise from DNA's
3-dimensional conformation. In order to study long-distance dependencies, we
develop and release a novel dataset for a larger-context modeling task. Using
this new data set we model long-distance interactions using dilated
convolutional neural networks, and compare them to standard convolutions and
recurrent neural networks. We show that dilated convolutions are effective at
modeling the locations of regulatory markers in the human genome, such as

    <title>Bayesian estimation of Differential Transcript Usage from RNA-seq data</title>
    <summary>  Next generation sequencing allows the identification of genes consisting of
differentially expressed transcripts, a term which usually refers to changes in
the overall expression level. A specific type of differential expression is
differential transcript usage (DTU) and targets changes in the relative within
gene expression of a transcript. The contribution of this paper is to: (a)
extend the use of cjBitSeq to the DTU context, a previously introduced Bayesian
model which is originally designed for identifying changes in overall
expression levels and (b) propose a Bayesian version of DRIMSeq, a frequentist
model for inferring DTU. cjBitSeq is a read based model and performs fully
Bayesian inference by MCMC sampling on the space of latent state of each
transcript per gene. BayesDRIMSeq is a count based model and estimates the
Bayes Factor of a DTU model against a null model using Laplace's approximation.
The proposed models are benchmarked against the existing ones using a recent
independent simulation study as well as a real RNA-seq dataset. Our results
suggest that the Bayesian methods exhibit similar performance with DRIMSeq in
terms of precision/recall but offer better calibration of False Discovery Rate.

    <title>Method for identification of condition-associated public antigen
  receptor sequences</title>
    <summary>  Diverse repertoires of hypervariable immunoglobulin receptors (TCR and BCR)
recognize antigens in the adaptive immune system. The development of
immunoglobulin receptor repertoire sequencing methods makes it possible to
perform repertoire-wide disease association studies of antigen receptor
sequences. We developed a statistical framework for associating receptors to
disease from only a small cohort of patients, with no need for a control
cohort. Our method successfully identifies previously validated Cytomegalovirus
and type 1 diabetes responsive receptors.

    <title>Large scale evaluation of differences between network-based and pairwise
  sequence-alignment-based methods of dendrogram reconstruction</title>
    <summary>  Dendrograms are a way to represent evolutionary relationships between
organisms. Nowadays, these are inferred based on the comparison of genes or
protein sequences by taking into account their differences and similarities.
The genetic material of choice for the sequence alignments (all the genes or
sets of genes) results in distinct inferred dendrograms. In this work, we
evaluate differences between dendrograms reconstructed with different
methodologies and obtained for different sets of organisms chosen at random
from a much larger set. A statistical analysis is performed in order to
estimate the fluctuation between the results obtained from the different
methodologies. This analysis permit us to validate a systematic approach, based
on the comparison of the organisms' metabolic networks for inferring
dendrograms. It has the advantage that it allows the comparison of organisms
very far away in the evolutionary tree even if they have no known ortholog gene
in common.

    <title>Accurate Genomic Prediction Of Human Height</title>
    <summary>  We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex human
quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment)
using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning).
Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, $\sim$40,
20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example,
predicted heights correlate $\sim$0.65 with actual height; actual heights of
most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction.
The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP
heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its
asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we
have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results
resolve the common SNP portion of the "missing heritability" problem -- i.e.,
the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The $\sim$20k
activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human
height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort,
comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also
use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation
of our results.

    <title>Improving spliced alignment for identification of ortholog groups and
  multiple CDS alignment</title>
    <summary>  The Spliced Alignment Problem (SAP) that consists in finding an optimal
semi-global alignment of a spliced RNA sequence on an unspliced genomic
sequence has been largely considered for the prediction and the annotation of
gene structures in genomes. Here, we re-visit it for the purpose of identifying
CDS ortholog groups within a set of CDS from homologous genes and for computing
multiple CDS alignments. We introduce a new constrained version of the spliced
alignment problem together with an algorithm that exploits full information on
the exon-intron structure of the input RNA and gene sequences in order to
compute high-coverage accurate alignments. We show how pairwise spliced
alignments between the CDS and the gene sequences of a gene family can be
directly used in order to clusterize the set of CDS of the gene family into a
set of ortholog groups. We also introduce an extension of the spliced alignment
problem called Multiple Spliced Alignment Problem (MSAP) that consists in
aligning simultaneously several RNA sequences on several genes from the same
gene family. We develop a heuristic algorithmic solution for the problem. We
show how to exploit multiple spliced alignments for the clustering of
homologous CDS into ortholog and close paralog groups, and for the construction
of multiple CDS alignments. An implementation of the method in Python is
available on demande to SFA@USherbrooke.ca.

    <title>Transkingdom Networks: A Systems Biology Approach to Identify Causal
  Members of Host-Microbiota Interactions</title>
    <summary>  Improvements in sequencing technologies and reduced experimental costs have
resulted in a vast number of studies generating high-throughput data. Although
the number of methods to analyze these "omics" data has also increased,
computational complexity and lack of documentation hinder researchers from
analyzing their high-throughput data to its true potential. In this chapter we
detail our data-driven, transkingdom network (TransNet) analysis protocol to
integrate and interrogate multi-omics data. This systems biology approach has
allowed us to successfully identify important causal relationships between
different taxonomic kingdoms (e.g. mammals and microbes) using diverse types of
data.

    <title>Identifying Genetic Risk Factors via Sparse Group Lasso with Group Graph
  Structure</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide association studies (GWA studies or GWAS) investigate the
relationships between genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and individual traits. Recently, incorporating biological priors
together with machine learning methods in GWA studies has attracted increasing
attention. However, in real-world, nucleotide-level bio-priors have not been
well-studied to date. Alternatively, studies at gene-level, for example,
protein--protein interactions and pathways, are more rigorous and legitimate,
and it is potentially beneficial to utilize such gene-level priors in GWAS. In
this paper, we proposed a novel two-level structured sparse model, called
Sparse Group Lasso with Group-level Graph structure (SGLGG), for GWAS. It can
be considered as a sparse group Lasso along with a group-level graph Lasso.
Essentially, SGLGG penalizes the nucleotide-level sparsity as well as takes
advantages of gene-level priors (both gene groups and networks), to identifying
phenotype-associated risk SNPs. We employ the alternating direction method of
multipliers algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Our experiments on the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative whole genome sequence data and
neuroimage data demonstrate the effectiveness of SGLGG. As a regression model,
it is competitive to the state-of-the-arts sparse models; as a variable
selection method, SGLGG is promising for identifying Alzheimer's
disease-related risk SNPs.

    <title>Phylogenetic Convolutional Neural Networks in Metagenomics</title>
    <summary>  Background: Convolutional Neural Networks can be effectively used only when
data are endowed with an intrinsic concept of neighbourhood in the input space,
as is the case of pixels in images. We introduce here Ph-CNN, a novel deep
learning architecture for the classification of metagenomics data based on the
Convolutional Neural Networks, with the patristic distance defined on the
phylogenetic tree being used as the proximity measure. The patristic distance
between variables is used together with a sparsified version of
MultiDimensional Scaling to embed the phylogenetic tree in a Euclidean space.
Results: Ph-CNN is tested with a domain adaptation approach on synthetic data
and on a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 38 healthy subjects and
222 Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, divided in 6 subclasses.
Classification performance is promising when compared to classical algorithms
like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest and a baseline fully connected
neural network, e.g. the Multi-Layer Perceptron. Conclusion: Ph-CNN represents
a novel deep learning approach for the classification of metagenomics data.
Operatively, the algorithm has been implemented as a custom Keras layer taking
care of passing to the following convolutional layer not only the data but also
the ranked list of neighbourhood of each sample, thus mimicking the case of
image data, transparently to the user. Keywords: Metagenomics; Deep learning;

    <title>Estimating phylogenetic distances between genomic sequences based on the
  length distribution of k-mismatch common substrings</title>
    <summary>  Various approaches to alignment-free sequence comparison are based on the
length of exact or inexact word matches between two input sequences. Haubold
{\em et al.} (2009) showed how the average number of substitutions between two
DNA sequences can be estimated based on the average length of exact common
substrings. In this paper, we study the length distribution of $k$-mismatch
common substrings between two sequences. We show that the number of
substitutions per position that have occurred since two sequences have evolved
from their last common ancestor, can be estimated from the position of a local
maximum in the length distribution of their $k$-mismatch common substrings.

    <title>Brain Gene Expression Analysis: a MATLAB toolbox for the analysis of
  brain-wide gene-expression data</title>
    <summary>  The Allen Brain Atlas project (ABA) generated a genome-scale collection of
gene-expression profiles using in-situ hybridization. These profiles were
co-registered to the three-dimensional Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) of the adult
mouse brain. A set of more than 4,000 such volumetric data are available for
the full brain, at a resolution of 200 microns. These data are presented in a
voxel-by-gene matrix. The ARA comes with several systems of annotation,
hierarchical (40 cortical regions, 209 sub-cortical regions in the whole
brain), or non-hierarchical (12 regions in the left hemisphere, with refinement
into 94 regions, and cortical layers). The high-dimensional nature of this
dataset and the possible connection between anatomy and gene expression pose
challenges to data analysis. We developed the Brain Gene Expression Analysis
Toolbox, whose functionalities include: determination of marker genes for brain
regions, statistical analysis of brain-wide co-expression patterns, and the
computation of brain-wide correlation maps with cell-type specific microarray
data.

    <title>Learning mutational graphs of individual tumor evolution from
  multi-sample sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Phylogenetic techniques quantify intra-tumor heterogeneity by deconvolving
either clonal or mutational trees from multi-sample sequencing data of
individual tumors. Most of these methods rely on the well-known infinite sites
assumption, and are limited to process either multi-region or single-cell
sequencing data. Here, we improve over those methods with TRaIT, a unified
statistical framework for the inference of the accumula- tion order of multiple
types of genomic alterations driving tumor development. TRaIT supports both
multi-region and single-cell sequencing data, and output mutational graphs
accounting for violations of the infinite sites assumption due to convergent
evolution, and other complex phenomena that cannot be detected with
phylogenetic tools. Our method displays better accuracy, performance and
robustness to noise and small sample size than state-of-the-art phylogenetic
methods. We show with single-cell data from breast cancer and multi-region data
from colorectal cancer that TRaIT can quantify the extent of intra-tumor
heterogeneity and generate new testable experimental hypotheses.

    <title>A practical fpt algorithm for Flow Decomposition and transcript assembly</title>
    <summary>  The Flow Decomposition problem, which asks for the smallest set of weighted
paths that "covers" a flow on a DAG, has recently been used as an important
computational step in transcript assembly. We prove the problem is in FPT when
parameterized by the number of paths by giving a practical linear fpt
algorithm. Further, we implement and engineer a Flow Decomposition solver based
on this algorithm, and evaluate its performance on RNA-sequence data.
Crucially, our solver finds exact solutions while achieving runtimes
competitive with a state-of-the-art heuristic. Finally, we contextualize our
design choices with two hardness results related to preprocessing and weight
recovery. Specifically, $k$-Flow Decomposition does not admit polynomial
kernels under standard complexity assumptions, and the related problem of
assigning (known) weights to a given set of paths is NP-hard.

    <title>Integrate Multi-omic Data Using Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) for Cancer
  Patient Clustering</title>
    <summary>  Clustering cancer patients into subgroups and identifying cancer subtypes is
an important task in cancer genomics. Clustering based on comprehensive
multi-omic molecular profiling can often achieve better results than those
using a single data type, since each omic data type (representing one view of
patients) may contain complementary information. However, it is challenging to
integrate heterogeneous omic data types directly. Based on one popular method
-- Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we presented Affinity Network Fusion (ANF)
in this paper, an "upgrade" of SNF with several advantages. Similar to SNF, ANF
treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity
(transition) matrix for clustering. We applied ANF to a carefully processed
harmonized cancer dataset downloaded from GDC data portals consisting of 2193
patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct
disease types. Our experimental results also demonstrated the power of feature
selection and transformation combined with using ANF in patient clustering.
Moreover, eigengap analysis suggests that the learned affinity matrices of four
cancer types using our proposed framework may have successfully captured
patient group structure and can be used for discovering unknown cancer
subtypes.

    <title>Estimating a common covariance matrix for network meta-analysis of gene
  expression datasets in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</title>
    <summary>  The estimation of covariance matrices of gene expressions has many
applications in cancer systems biology. Many gene expression studies, however,
are hampered by low sample size and it has therefore become popular to increase
sample size by collecting gene expression data across studies. Motivated by the
traditional meta-analysis using random effects models, we present a
hierarchical random covariance model and use it for the meta-analysis of gene
correlation networks across 11 large-scale gene expression studies of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We suggest to use a maximum likelihood estimator
for the underlying common covariance matrix and introduce an EM algorithm for
estimation. By simulation experiments comparing the estimated covariance
matrices by cophenetic correlation and Kullback-Leibler divergence the
suggested estimator showed to perform better or not worse than a simple pooled
estimator. In a posthoc analysis of the estimated common covariance matrix for
the DLBCL data we were able to identify novel biologically meaningful gene
correlation networks with eigengenes of prognostic value. In conclusion, the
method seems to provide a generally applicable framework for meta-analysis,
when multiple features are measured and believed to share a common covariance
matrix obscured by study dependent noise.

    <title>Integrative analysis reveals disrupted pathways regulated by microRNAs
  in cancer</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous regulatory molecules that modulate
gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although differential expression of
miRNAs have been implicated in many diseases (including cancers), the
underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Because each miRNA can target
multiple genes, miRNAs may potentially have functional implications for the
overall behavior of entire pathways. Here we investigate the functional
consequences of miRNA dysregulation through an integrative analysis of miRNA
and mRNA expression data using a novel approach that incorporates pathway
information a priori. By searching for miRNA-pathway associations that differ
between healthy and tumor tissue, we identify specific relationships at the
systems-level which are disrupted in cancer. Our approach is motivated by the
hypothesis that if a miRNA and pathway are associated, then the expression of
the miRNA and the collective behavior of the genes in a pathway will be
correlated. As such, we first obtain an expression-based summary of pathway
activity using Isomap, a dimension reduction method which can articulate
nonlinear structure in high-dimensional data. We then search for miRNAs that
exhibit differential correlations with the pathway summary between phenotypes
as a means of finding aberrant miRNA-pathway coregulation in tumors. We apply
our method to cancer data using gene and miRNA expression datasets from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compare ${\sim}10^5$ miRNA-pathway relationships
between healthy and tumor samples from four tissues (breast, prostate, lung,
and liver). Many of the flagged pairs we identify have a biological basis for
disruption in cancer.

    <title>Measures of hydroxymethylation</title>
    <summary>  Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) methylation is known to be a possible epigenetic
mark impacting genome stability. In this paper, we address the existing 5hmC
measure $\Delta \beta$ and discuss its properties both analytically and
empirically on real data. Then we introduce several alternative
hydroxymethylation measures and compare their properties with those of $\Delta
\beta$. All results will be illustrated by means of real data analyses.

    <title>Warp: a method for neural network interpretability applied to gene
  expression profiles</title>
    <summary>  We show a proof of principle for warping, a method to interpret the inner
working of neural networks in the context of gene expression analysis. Warping
is an efficient way to gain insight to the inner workings of neural nets and
make them more interpretable. We demonstrate the ability of warping to recover
meaningful information for a given class on a samplespecific individual basis.
We found warping works well in both linearly and nonlinearly separable
datasets. These encouraging results show that warping has a potential to be the
answer to neural networks interpretability in computational biology.

    <title>GRIM-filter: fast seed filtering in read mapping using emerging memory
  technologies</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Seed filtering is critical in DNA read mapping, a process where
billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a donor are mapped onto a
reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor. Read mappers 1)
quickly generate possible mapping locations (i.e., seeds) for each read, 2)
extract reference sequences at each of the mapping locations, and then 3) check
similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a
computationally expensive dynamic programming algorithm (alignment) to
determine the origin of the read. Location filters come into play before
alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would have deemed a poor
match. The ideal location filter would discard all poor matching locations
prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on poor alignments.
  Results: We propose a novel filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to
exploit emerging 3D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a
stacked logic layer, enabling processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly
filters locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained
segments of the reference genome and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory
operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our
evaluations show that for 5% error acceptance rates, GRIM-Filter eliminates
5.59x-6.41x more false negatives and exhibits end-to-end speedups of
1.81x-3.65x compared to mappers employing the best previous filtering
algorithm.

    <title>Determining whether the non-protein-coding DNA sequences are in a
  complex interactive relationship by using an artificial intelligence method</title>
    <summary>  Non protein coding regions of the human genome contain many complex patterns
which regulate the cellular activity. Studying the human genome is limited by
the lack of understanding of its features and their complex interactions.
However, recent advances in AI research have enabled automatically learning
representations of high dimensional complex data without feature engineering,
using deep neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate that a
convolutional neural network can learn a representation of DNA sequence without
specifying any motifs or patterns, such that it becomes capable of predicting
whether a DNA sequence is natural or artificial. The trained model could
distinguish scrambled vs real DNA sequences for scrambling lengths of 2 bp, 10
bp, 50 bp and even 100 bp, with a significantly higher accuracy than linear
SVMs. With this study, we have discovered that regions of non protein coding
DNA might have meaningful interactions at even longer than 100 bp distances
even though they do not code proteins.

    <title>Exponential scaling of single-cell RNA-seq in the last decade</title>
    <summary>  The ability to measure the transcriptomes of single cells has only been
feasible for a few years, and is becoming an extremely popular assay. While
many types of analysis and questions can be answered using single cell
RNA-sequencing, a central focus is the ability to survey the diversity of cell
types within a sample. Unbiased and reproducible cataloging of distinct cell
types requires large numbers of cells. Technological developments and protocol
improvements have fuelled a consistent exponential increase in the numbers of
cells studied in single cell RNA-seq analyses. In this perspective, we will
highlight the key technological developments which have enabled this growth in
data.

    <title>DNA Sequence Complexity Reveals Structure Beyond GC Content in
  Nucleosome Occupancy</title>
    <summary>  We introduce methods that rapidly evaluate a battery of information-theoretic
and algorithmic complexity measures on DNA sequences in application to
potential binding sites for nucleosomes. The first application of this new tool
demonstrates structure beyond GC content on DNA sequences in the context of
nucleosome binding. We tested the measures on well-studied genomic sequences of
size 20K and 100K bps. The measures reveal the known in vivo versus in vitro
predictive discrepancies, but they also uncover the internal structure of G and
C within the nucleosome length, thus disclosing more than simply GC content
when one examines alphabet transformations that separate and scramble the GC
content signal and the DNA sequence. Most current prediction methods are based
upon training (e.g. $k$-mer discovery), the one here advanced, however, is a
training-free approach to investigating informative measures of DNA information
content in connection with structural nucleosomic packing.

    <title>Topological transition in bacterial protein-protein interaction networks
  ruled by gene conservation, essentiality and function</title>
    <summary>  Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are the backbone of all processes
in living cells. In this work we investigate how gene conservation,
essentiality and functional repertoire are reflected in the connectivity $k$ of
the corresponding proteins in the PPI networks of 42 evolutionarily unrelated
bacterial species. We investigate three issues: i) the degree distribution and
densities of the PPI subnetworks of essential and nonessential genes; ii) how
the conservation of genes, measured both by the evolutionary retention index
(ERI) and by evolutionary pressure (as represented by the ratio $K_a/K_s$) is
related to the the degree of the corresponding protein in the PPI network; iii)
how k of the PPI networks selects functional repertoires, as represented by the
Clusters of Orthologous Proteins (COGs). We show that conservation,
essentiality and functional specialisation of the genes control in a universal
way the topology of the emerging bacterial PPI networks. Noteworthy, a phase
transition is observed such that, for $k\ge40$, bacterial PPI network are
mostly populated by genes that are conserved, essential and which, in most
cases, belong to the COG J, a category of genes which is related to ribosomal
functions and to the processing of genetic information.

    <title>Quantifying homologous proteins and proteoforms</title>
    <summary>  Many proteoforms - arising from alternative splicing, post-translational
modifications (PTMs), or paralogous genes - have distinct biological functions,
such as histone PTM proteoforms. However, their quantification by existing
bottom-up mass-spectrometry (MS) methods is undermined by peptide-specific
biases. To avoid these biases, we developed and implemented a first-principles
model (HIquant) for quantifying proteoform stoichiometries. We characterized
when MS data allow inferring proteoform stoichiometries by HIquant, derived an
algorithm for optimal inference, and demonstrated experimentally high accuracy
in quantifying fractional PTM occupancy without using external standards, even
in the challenging case of the histone modification code.

    <title>Network modelling of topological domains using Hi-C data</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture techniques such as Hi-C enable
the generation of 3D genome contact maps and offer new pathways toward
understanding the spatial organization of genome. One specific feature of the
3D organization is known as topologically associating domains (TADs), which are
densely interacting, contiguous chromatin regions playing important roles in
regulating gene expression. A few algorithms have been proposed to detect TADs.
In particular, the structure of Hi-C data naturally inspires application of
community detection methods. However, one of the drawbacks of community
detection is that most methods take exchangeability of the nodes in the network
for granted; whereas the nodes in this case, i.e. the positions on the
chromosomes, are not exchangeable. We propose a network model for detecting
TADs using Hi-C data that takes into account this non-exchangeability. In
addition, our model explicitly makes use of cell-type specific CTCF binding
sites as biological covariates and can be used to identify conserved TADs
across multiple cell types. The model leads to a likelihood objective that can
be efficiently optimized via relaxation. We also prove that when suitably
initialized, this model finds the underlying TAD structure with high
probability. Using simulated data, we show the advantages of our method and the
caveats of popular community detection methods, such as spectral clustering, in
this application. Applying our method to real Hi-C data, we demonstrate the
domains identified have desirable epigenetic features and compare them across
different cell types. The code is available upon request.

    <title>BGT: efficient and flexible genotype query across many samples</title>
    <summary>  Summary: BGT is a compact format, a fast command line tool and a simple web
application for efficient and convenient query of whole-genome genotypes and
frequencies across tens to hundreds of thousands of samples. On real data, it
encodes the haplotypes of 32,488 samples across 39.2 million SNPs into a 7.4GB
database and decodes a couple of hundred million genotypes per CPU second. The
high performance enables real-time responses to complex queries.

    <title>Minimap and miniasm: fast mapping and de novo assembly for noisy long
  sequences</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technology and Oxford
Nanopore technologies (ONT) produce reads over 10kbp in length, which have
enabled high-quality genome assembly at an affordable cost. However, at
present, long reads have an error rate as high as 10-15%. Complex and
computationally intensive pipelines are required to assemble such reads.
  Results: We present a new mapper, minimap, and a de novo assembler, miniasm,
for efficiently mapping and assembling SMRT and ONT reads without an error
correction stage. They can often assemble a sequencing run of bacterial data
into a single contig in a few minutes, and assemble 45-fold C. elegans data in
9 minutes, orders of magnitude faster than the existing pipelines. We also
introduce a pairwise read mapping format (PAF) and a graphical fragment
assembly format (GFA), and demonstrate the interoperability between ours and
current tools.

    <title>Mutation Clusters from Cancer Exome</title>
    <summary>  We apply our statistically deterministic machine learning/clustering
algorithm *K-means (recently developed in https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908286) to
10,656 published exome samples for 32 cancer types. A majority of cancer types
exhibit mutation clustering structure. Our results are in-sample stable. They
are also out-of-sample stable when applied to 1,389 published genome samples
across 14 cancer types. In contrast, we find in- and out-of-sample
instabilities in cancer signatures extracted from exome samples via nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), a computationally costly and non-deterministic
method. Extracting stable mutation structures from exome data could have
important implications for speed and cost, which are critical for early-stage
cancer diagnostics such as novel blood-test methods currently in development.

    <title>Hierarchical clustering of DNA k-mer counts in RNA-seq fastq files
  reveals batch effects</title>
    <summary>  Batch effects, artificial sources of variation due to experimental design,
are a widespread phenomenon in high throughput data. Therefore, mechanisms for
detection of batch effects are needed requiring comparison of multiple samples.
We apply hierarchical clustering (HC) on DNA k-mer counts of multiple RNA-seq
derived Fastq files. Ideally, HC generated trees reflect experimental treatment
groups and thus may indicate experimental effects, but clustering of
preparation groups indicates the presence of batch effects. In order to provide
a simple applicable tool we implemented sequential analysis of Fastq reads with
low memory usage in an R package (seqTools) available on Bioconductor. DNA
k-mer counts were analysed on 61 Fastq files containing RNA-seq data from two
cell types (dermal fibroblasts and Jurkat cells) sequenced on 8 different
Illumina Flowcells. Results: Pairwise comparison of all Flowcells with
hierarchical clustering revealed strong Flowcell based tree separation in 6 (21
%) and detectable Flowcell based clustering in 17 (60.7 %) of 28 Flowcell
comparisons. In our samples, batch effects were also present in reads mapped to
the human genome. Filtering reads for high quality (Phred &gt;30) did not remove
the batch effects. Conclusions: Hierarchical clustering of DNA k-mer counts
provides a quality criterion and an unspecific diagnostic tool for RNA-seq
experiments.

    <title>*K-means and Cluster Models for Cancer Signatures</title>
    <summary>  We present *K-means clustering algorithm and source code by expanding
statistical clustering methods applied in https://ssrn.com/abstract=2802753 to
quantitative finance. *K-means is statistically deterministic without
specifying initial centers, etc. We apply *K-means to extracting cancer
signatures from genome data without using nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF). *K-means' computational cost is a fraction of NMF's. Using 1,389
published samples for 14 cancer types, we find that 3 cancers (liver cancer,
lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma) stand out and do not have cluster-like
structures. Two clusters have especially high within-cluster correlations with
11 other cancers indicating common underlying structures. Our approach opens a
novel avenue for studying such structures. *K-means is universal and can be
applied in other fields. We discuss some potential applications in quantitative
finance.

    <title>A spectral algorithm for fast de novo layout of uncorrected long
  nanopore reads</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: New long read sequencers promise to transform sequencing and
genome assembly by producing reads tens of kilobases long. However their high
error rate significantly complicates assembly and requires expensive correction
steps to layout the reads using standard assembly engines.
  Results: We present an original and efficient spectral algorithm to layout
the uncorrected nanopore reads, and its seamless integration into a
straightforward overlap/layout/consensus (OLC) assembly scheme. The method is
shown to assemble Oxford Nanopore reads from several bacterial genomes into
good quality (~99% identity to the reference) genome-sized contigs, while
yielding more fragmented assemblies from a Sacharomyces cerevisiae reference
strain.

    <title>Discovery of new drug therapeutic indications from gene mutation
  information for hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
    <summary>  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy
and is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. However, cure is not
possible with currently used therapies, and there is not so much approved
targeted therapy for HCC despite numerous attempts and clinical trials. So, it
is essential to identify additional therapeutic strategies to block the growth
of HCC tumors. As a cancer disease, it is associated with aberrant genomic and
transcriptional landscapes. We sought to use a systematic drug repositioning
bioinformatics approach to identify novel candidate drugs to treat HCC, which
considers not only aberrant genomic information, but also the changes of
transcriptional landscapes. First, we screen the collection of HCC feature
genes that frequently mutated in most samples of HCC based on human mutation
data. Then, the gene expression data of HCC in TCGA are combined to classify
the kernel genes of HCC. Finally, the therapeutic score (TS) of each drug is
calculated based on the kolmogorov-smirnov statistical method. Using this
strategy, we identified five drugs that associated with HCC, including three
drugs that could treat HCC and two drugs that might have side-effect on HCC. In
addition, we also make Connectivity Map (CMap) profiles similarity analysis and
KEGG enrichment analysis on drug targets. All these findings suggest that our
approach is effective for accurate discovering novel therapeutic options for
HCC and easily to be extended to other tumors.

    <title>An Algorithm for Cellular Reprogramming</title>
    <summary>  The day we understand the time evolution of subcellular elements at a level
of detail comparable to physical systems governed by Newton's laws of motion
seems far away. Even so, quantitative approaches to cellular dynamics add to
our understanding of cell biology, providing data-guided frameworks that allow
us to develop better predictions about and methods for control over specific
biological processes and system-wide cell behavior. In this paper we describe
an approach to optimizing the use of transcription factors in the context of
cellular reprogramming. We construct an approximate model for the natural
evolution of a synchronized population of fibroblasts, based on data obtained
by sampling the expression of some 22,083 genes at several times along the cell
cycle. (These data are based on a colony of cells that have been cell cycle
synchronized) In order to arrive at a model of moderate complexity, we cluster
gene expression based on the division of the genome into topologically
associating domains (TADs) and then model the dynamics of the expression levels
of the TADs. Based on this dynamical model and known bioinformatics, we develop
a methodology for identifying the transcription factors that are the most
likely to be effective toward a specific cellular reprogramming task. The
approach used is based on a device commonly used in optimal control. From this
data-guided methodology, we identify a number of validated transcription
factors used in reprogramming and/or natural differentiation. Our findings
highlight the immense potential of dynamical models models, mathematics, and
data guided methodologies for improving methods for control over biological
processes.

    <title>A Stochastic Model for the Formation of Spatial Methylation Patterns</title>
    <summary>  DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism whose important role in
development has been widely recognized. This epigenetic modification results in
heritable changes in gene expression not encoded by the DNA sequence. The
underlying mechanisms controlling DNA methylation are only partly understood
and recently different mechanistic models of enzyme activities responsible for
DNA methylation have been proposed. Here we extend existing Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) for DNA methylation by describing the occurrence of spatial
methylation patterns over time and propose several models with different
neighborhood dependencies. We perform numerical analysis of the HMMs applied to
bisulfite sequencing measurements and accurately predict wild-type data. In
addition, we find evidence that the enzymes' activities depend on the left 5'
neighborhood but not on the right 3' neighborhood.

    <title>MAGNET: Understanding and Improving the Accuracy of Genome Pre-Alignment
  Filtering</title>
    <summary>  In the era of high throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies, calculating
the edit distance (i.e., the minimum number of substitutions, insertions, and
deletions between a pair of sequences) for billions of genomic sequences is the
computational bottleneck in todays read mappers. The shifted Hamming distance
(SHD) algorithm proposes a fast filtering strategy that can rapidly filter out
invalid mappings that have more edits than allowed. However, SHD shows high
inaccuracy in its filtering by admitting invalid mappings to be marked as
correct ones. This wastes the execution time and imposes a large computational
burden. In this work, we comprehensively investigate four sources that lead to
the filtering inaccuracy. We propose MAGNET, a new filtering strategy that
maintains high accuracy across different edit distance thresholds and data
sets. It significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by one
to two orders of magnitude. The MATLAB implementations of MAGNET and SHD are
open source and available at: https://github.com/BilkentCompGen/MAGNET.

    <title>Dissimilar Symmetric Word Pairs in the Human Genome</title>
    <summary>  In this work we explore the dissimilarity between symmetric word pairs, by
comparing the inter-word distance distribution of a word to that of its
reversed complement. We propose a new measure of dissimilarity between such
distributions. Since symmetric pairs with different patterns could point to
evolutionary features, we search for the pairs with the most dissimilar
behaviour. We focus our study on the complete human genome and its
repeat-masked version.

    <title>DUDE-Seq: Fast, Flexible, and Robust Denoising for Targeted Amplicon
  Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  We consider the correction of errors from nucleotide sequences produced by
next-generation targeted amplicon sequencing. The next-generation sequencing
(NGS) platforms can provide a great deal of sequencing data thanks to their
high throughput, but the associated error rates often tend to be high.
Denoising in high-throughput sequencing has thus become a crucial process for
boosting the reliability of downstream analyses. Our methodology, named
DUDE-Seq, is derived from a general setting of reconstructing finite-valued
source data corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel and effectively corrects
substitution and homopolymer indel errors, the two major types of sequencing
errors in most high-throughput targeted amplicon sequencing platforms. Our
experimental studies with real and simulated datasets suggest that the proposed
DUDE-Seq not only outperforms existing alternatives in terms of
error-correction capability and time efficiency, but also boosts the
reliability of downstream analyses. Further, the flexibility of DUDE-Seq
enables its robust application to different sequencing platforms and analysis
pipelines by simple updates of the noise model. DUDE-Seq is available at
http://data.snu.ac.kr/pub/dude-seq.

    <title>A Linear Algebra Approach to Fast DNA Mixture Analysis Using GPUs</title>
    <summary>  Analysis of DNA samples is an important step in forensics, and the speed of
analysis can impact investigations. Comparison of DNA sequences is based on the
analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs), which are short DNA sequences of 2-5
base pairs. Current forensics approaches use 20 STR loci for analysis. The use
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has utility for analysis of complex
DNA mixtures. The use of tens of thousands of SNPs loci for analysis poses
significant computational challenges because the forensic analysis scales by
the product of the loci count and number of DNA samples to be analyzed. In this
paper, we discuss the implementation of a DNA sequence comparison algorithm by
re-casting the algorithm in terms of linear algebra primitives. By developing
an overloaded matrix multiplication approach to DNA comparisons, we can
leverage advances in GPU hardware and algoithms for Dense Generalized
Matrix-Multiply (DGEMM) to speed up DNA sample comparisons. We show that it is
possible to compare 2048 unknown DNA samples with 20 million known samples in
under 6 seconds using a NVIDIA K80 GPU.

    <title>DNA insertion mutations can be predicted by a periodic probability
  function</title>
    <summary>  It is generally difficult to predict the positions of mutations in genomic
DNA at the nucleotide level. Retroviral DNA insertion is one mode of mutation,
resulting in host infections that are difficult to treat. This mutation process
involves the integration of retroviral DNA into the host-infected cellular
genomic DNA following the interaction between host DNA and a pre-integration
complex consisting of retroviral DNA and integrase. Here, we report that
retroviral insertion sites around a hotspot within the Zfp521 and N-myc genes
can be predicted by a periodic function that is deduced using the diffraction
lattice model. In conclusion, the mutagenesis process is described by a
biophysical model for DNA-DNA interactions.

    <title>Predicting potential treatments for complex diseases based on miRNA and
  tissue specificity</title>
    <summary>  Drug repositioning, that is finding new uses for existing drugs to treat more
patients. Cumulative studies demonstrate that the mature miRNAs as well as
their precursors can be targeted by small molecular drugs. At the same time,
human diseases result from the disordered interplay of tissue- and cell
lineage-specific processes. However, few computational researches predict
drug-disease potential relationships based on miRNA data and tissue
specificity. Therefore, based on miRNA data and the tissue specificity of
diseases, we propose a new method named as miTS to predict the potential
treatments for diseases. Firstly, based on miRNAs data, target genes and
information of FDA approved drugs, we evaluate the relationships between miRNAs
and drugs in the tissue-specific PPI network. Then, we construct a tripartite
network: drug-miRNA-disease Finally, we obtain the potential drug-disease
associations based on the tripartite network. In this paper, we take breast
cancer as case study and focus on the top-30 predicted drugs. 25 of them
(83.3%) are found having known connections with breast cancer in CTD benchmark
and the other 5 drugs are potential drugs for breast cancer. We further
evaluate the 5 newly predicted drugs from clinical records, literature mining,
KEGG pathways enrichment analysis and overlapping genes between enriched
pathways. For each of the 5 new drugs, strongly supported evidences can be
found in three or more aspects. In particular, Regorafenib has 15 overlapping
KEGG pathways with breast cancer and their p-values are all very small. In
addition, whether in the literature curation or clinical validation,
Regorafenib has a strong correlation with breast cancer. All the facts show
that Regorafenib is likely to be a truly effective drug, worthy of our further
study. It further follows that our method miTS is effective and practical for
predicting new drug indications.

    <title>A Pipeline for Insertion Sequence Detection and Study for Bacterial
  Genome</title>
    <summary>  Insertion Sequences (ISs) are small DNA segments that have the ability of
moving themselves into genomes. These types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs)
seem to play an essential role in genomes rearrangements and evolution of
prokaryotic genomes, but the tools that deal with discovering ISs in an
efficient and accurate way are still too few and not totally precise. Two main
factors have big effects on IS discovery, namely: genes annotation and
functionality prediction. Indeed, some specific genes called "transposases" are
enzymes that are responsible of the production and catalysis for such
transposition, but there is currently no fully accurate method that could
decide whether a given predicted gene is either a real transposase or not. This
is why authors of this article aim at designing a novel pipeline for ISs
detection and classification, which embeds the most recently available tools
developed in this field of research, namely OASIS (Optimized Annotation System
for Insertion Sequence) and ISFinder database (an up-to-date and accurate
repository of known insertion sequences). As this latter depend on predicted
coding sequences, the proposed pipeline will encompass too various kinds of
bacterial genes annotation tools (that is, Prokka, BASys, and Prodigal). A
complete IS detection and classification pipeline is then proposed and tested
on a set of 23 complete genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pipeline can
also be used as an investigator of annotation tools performance, which has led
us to conclude that Prodigal is the best software for IS prediction. A deepen
study regarding IS elements in P.aeruginosa has then been conducted, leading to
the conclusion that close genomes inside this species have also a close numbers
of IS families and groups.

    <title>Genetic variation in human drug-related genes</title>
    <summary>  Variability in drug efficacy and adverse effects are observed in clinical
practice. While the extent of genetic variability in classical pharmacokinetic
genes is rather well understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets
is typically less studied. Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset,
we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of
functional-variants in in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug
targets. We find that most genetic variants in these genes are very rare (f &lt;
0.1%) and thus likely not observed in clinical trials. Overall, however, four
in five patients are likely to carry a functional-variant in a target for
commonly prescribed drugs and many of these might alter drug efficacy. We
further computed the likelihood of 1,236 FDA approved drugs to be affected by
functional-variants in their targets and show that the patient-risk varies for
many drugs with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused analysis of
oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying
germline variants in oncological drug targets is with 44% high enough to
suggest that not only somatic alterations, but also germline variants carried
over into the tumor genome should be included in therapeutic decision-making.

    <title>Relation between Insertion Sequences and Genome Rearrangements in
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
    <summary>  During evolution of microorganisms genomes underwork have different changes
in their lengths, gene orders, and gene contents. Investigating these
structural rearrangements helps to understand how genomes have been modified
over time. Some elements that play an important role in genome rearrangements
are called insertion sequences (ISs), they are the simplest types of
transposable elements (TEs) that widely spread within prokaryotic genomes. ISs
can be defined as DNA segments that have the ability to move (cut and paste)
themselves to another location within the same chromosome or not. Due to their
ability to move around, they are often presented as responsible of some of
these genomic recombination. Authors of this research work have regarded this
claim, by checking if a relation between insertion sequences (ISs) and genome
rearrangements can be found. To achieve this goal, a new pipeline that combines
various tools have firstly been designed, for detecting the distribution of
ORFs that belongs to each IS category. Secondly, links between these predicted
ISs and observed rearrangements of two close genomes have been investigated, by
seeing them with the naked eye, and by using computational approaches. The
proposal has been tested on 18 complete bacterial genomes of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, leading to the conclusion that IS3 family of insertion sequences
are related to genomic inversions.

    <title>The adaptive acquisition of single DNA segments drives metabolic
  evolution across E. coli lineages</title>
    <summary>  Even closely related prokaryotes show an astounding diversity in their
ability to grow in different nutritional environments. Mechanistically, this
diversity arises predominantly through horizontal gene transfer, the exchange
of DNA between individuals from different strains. It has been hypothesized
that complex metabolic adaptations--those requiring the acquisition of multiple
distinct DNA segments--can evolve via selectively neutral intermediate steps;
an alternative explanation rests on the existence of intermediate environments
that make each individual DNA acquisition adaptive. However, it is unclear how
important changing environments are compared to neutral explorations of
phenotype space; more fundamentally, it is unknown what fraction of metabolic
adaptations are indeed complex. Here, we use metabolic network simulations to
show that all 3,363 phenotypic innovations observed in the evolutionary history
of 53 E. coli strains arose through the acquisition of a single DNA segment;
while we found no evidence for the contribution of selectively neutral
processes, 10.6% of adaptations to previously unviable environments relied on
the support of DNA acquisitions on earlier phylogenetic branches. 97.0% of all
metabolic phenotypes accessible for the E. coli pan-genome could be bestowed on
any ancestral strain by transferring a single DNA segment from one of the
extant strains. These results demonstrate an amazing ability of the E. coli
lineage to quickly adapt to previously inaccessible environments through a
single DNA acquisition, an ability likely to be mirrored in other clades of
generalist bacteria.

    <title>Convolutional Kitchen Sinks for Transcription Factor Binding Site
  Prediction</title>
    <summary>  We present a simple and efficient method for prediction of transcription
factor binding sites from DNA sequence. Our method computes a random
approximation of a convolutional kernel feature map from DNA sequence and then
learns a linear model from the approximated feature map. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art deep learning methods on five out of six test datasets from
the ENCODE consortium, while training in less than one eighth the time.

    <title>Network-based identification of disease genes in expression data: the
  GeneSurrounder method</title>
    <summary>  The advent of high--throughput transcription profiling technologies has
enabled identification of genes and pathways associated with disease, providing
new avenues for precision medicine. A key challenge is to analyze this data in
the context of the regulatory networks and pathways that control cellular
processes, while still obtaining insights that can be used to design new
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. While classical differential
expression analysis provides specific and hence targetable gene-level insights,
it does not include any systems--level information. On the other hand, pathway
analyses integrate systems--level information with expression data, but are
often limited in their ability to indicate specific molecular targets. We
introduce GeneSurrounder, an analysis method that takes into account the
complex structure of interaction networks to identify specific genes that
disrupt pathway activity in a disease--specific manner. GeneSurrounder
integrates transcriptomic data and pathway network information in a novel
two--step procedure to detect genes that (i) appear to influence the expression
of other genes local to it in the network and (ii) are part of a subnetwork of
differentially expressed genes. Combined, this evidence can be used to pinpoint
specific genes that have a mechanistic role in the phenotype of interest.
Applying GeneSurrounder to three distinct ovarian cancer studies using a global
KEGG network, we show that our method is able to identify biologically relevant
genes and genes missed by single-gene association tests, integrate pathway and
expression data, and yield more consistent results across multiple studies of
the same phenotype than competing methods.

    <title>MDA in Capillary for Whole Genome Amplification</title>
    <summary>  Whole genome amplification (WGA) plays an important role in sample
preparation of low-input templates for high-throughput sequencing. Multiple
displacement amplification (MDA), a popular isothermal WGA method, suffers a
major hurdle of highly uneven amplification. Optimizations have been made in
the past by separating the reagents into numbers of tiny chambers or droplets
in microfluidic devices, which significantly improves the amplification
uniformity of MDA. However, skill barrier still exists for biological
researchers to handle chip fabrication and droplet manipulation. Here, we
present a novel MDA protocol, in-capillary MDA (icMDA), which significantly
simplifies the manipulation and improves the uniformity of amplification by
dispersing reagents in a long quasi-1D capillary tubing. We demonstrated that
icMDA is able to accurately detect SNVs with higher efficiency and sensitivity.
Moreover, this straightforward method employs neither customized instruments
nor complicated operations, making it a ready-to-use approach for most
laboratories.

    <title>FSG: Fast String Graph Construction for De Novo Assembly of Reads Data</title>
    <summary>  The string graph for a collection of next-generation reads is a lossless data
representation that is fundamental for de novo assemblers based on the
overlap-layout-consensus paradigm. In this paper, we explore a novel approach
to compute the string graph, based on the FM-index and Burrows-Wheeler
Transform. We describe a simple algorithm that uses only the FM-index
representation of the collection of reads to construct the string graph,
without accessing the input reads. Our algorithm has been integrated into the
SGA assembler as a standalone module to construct the string graph.
  The new integrated assembler has been assessed on a standard benchmark,
showing that FSG is significantly faster than SGA while maintaining a moderate
use of main memory, and showing practical advantages in running FSG on multiple
threads.

    <title>Estimation of the True Evolutionary Distance under the Fragile Breakage
  Model</title>
    <summary>  The ability to estimate the evolutionary distance between extant genomes
plays a crucial role in many phylogenomic studies. Often such estimation is
based on the parsimony assumption, implying that the distance between two
genomes can be estimated as the rearrangement distance equal the minimal number
of genome rearrangements required to transform one genome into the other.
However, in reality the parsimony assumption may not always hold, emphasizing
the need for estimation that does not rely on the rearrangement distance. The
distance that accounts for the actual (rather than minimal) number of
rearrangements between two genomes is often referred to as the true
evolutionary distance. While there exists a method for the true evolutionary
distance estimation, it however assumes that genomes can be broken by
rearrangements equally likely at any position in the course of evolution. This
assumption, known as the random breakage model, has recently been refuted in
favor of the more rigorous fragile breakage model postulating that only certain
"fragile" genomic regions are prone to rearrangements.
  We propose a new method for estimating the true evolutionary distance between
two genomes under the fragile breakage model. We evaluate the proposed method
on simulated genomes, which show its high accuracy. We further apply the
proposed method for estimation of evolutionary distances within a set of five
yeast genomes and a set of two fish genomes.

    <title>Role of distal enhancers in shaping 3D-folding patterns and defining
  human-specific features of interphase chromatin architecture in embryonic
  stem cells</title>
    <summary>  Molecular and genetic definitions of human-specific changes to genomic
regulatory networks (GRNs) contributing to development of unique to human
phenotypes remain a highly significant challenge. Genome-wide proximity
placement analysis of diverse families of human-specific genomic regulatory
loci (HSGRL) identified topologically-associating domains (TADs) that are
significantly enriched for HSGRL and designated rapidly-evolving in humans TADs
(Genome Biol Evol. 2016 8; 2774-88). Here, the analysis of HSGRL, hESC-enriched
enhancers, super-enhancers (SEs), and specific sub-TAD structures termed
super-enhancer domains (SEDs) has been performed. Markedly distinct features of
the principal regulatory structures of interphase chromatin evolved in the hESC
genome compared to mouse: the SED quantity is 3-fold higher and the median SED
size is significantly larger. Concomitantly, the overall TAD quantity is
increased by 42% while the median TAD size is significantly decreased (p =
9.11E-37) in the hESC genome. Present analyses illustrate a putative global
role for HSGRL in shaping the human-specific features of the interphase
chromatin organization and functions, which are facilitated by accelerated
creation of new enhancers associated with targeted placement of HSGRL at
defined genomic coordinates. A trend toward the convergence of TAD and SED
architectures of interphase chromatin in the hESC genome may reflect changes of
3D-folding patterns of linear chromatin fibers designed to enhance both
regulatory complexity and functional precision of GRNs by creating
predominantly a single gene per regulatory domain structures.

    <title>Cell-to-cell variability and robustness in S-phase duration from genome
  replication kinetics</title>
    <summary>  Genome replication, a key process for a cell, relies on stochastic initiation
by replication origins, causing a variability of replication timing from cell
to cell. While stochastic models of eukaryotic replication are widely
available, the link between the key parameters and overall replication timing
has not been addressed systematically.We use a combined analytical and
computational approach to calculate how positions and strength of many origins
lead to a given cell-to-cell variability of total duration of the replication
of a large region, a chromosome or the entire genome.Specifically, the total
replication timing can be framed as an extreme-value problem, since it is due
to the last region that replicates in each cell. Our calculations identify two
regimes based on the spread between characteristic completion times of all
inter-origin regions of a genome. For widely different completion times, timing
is set by the single specific region that is typically the last to replicate in
all cells. Conversely, when the completion time of all regions are
comparable,an extreme-value estimate shows that the cell-to-cell variability of
genome replication timing has universal properties. Comparison with available
data shows that the replication program of three yeast species falls in this
extreme-value regime.

    <title>Modeling Persistent Trends in Distributions</title>
    <summary>  We present a nonparametric framework to model a short sequence of probability
distributions that vary both due to underlying effects of sequential
progression and confounding noise. To distinguish between these two types of
variation and estimate the sequential-progression effects, our approach
leverages an assumption that these effects follow a persistent trend. This work
is motivated by the recent rise of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments over
a brief time course, which aim to identify genes relevant to the progression of
a particular biological process across diverse cell populations. While
classical statistical tools focus on scalar-response regression or
order-agnostic differences between distributions, it is desirable in this
setting to consider both the full distributions as well as the structure
imposed by their ordering. We introduce a new regression model for ordinal
covariates where responses are univariate distributions and the underlying
relationship reflects consistent changes in the distributions over increasing
levels of the covariate. This concept is formalized as a "trend" in
distributions, which we define as an evolution that is linear under the
Wasserstein metric. Implemented via a fast alternating projections algorithm,
our method exhibits numerous strengths in simulations and analyses of
single-cell gene expression data.

    <title>IGoR: a tool for high-throughput immune repertoire analysis</title>
    <summary>  High throughput immune repertoire sequencing is promising to lead to new
statistical diagnostic tools for medicine and biology. Successful
implementations of these methods require a correct characterization, analysis
and interpretation of these datasets. We present IGoR -- a new comprehensive
tool that takes B or T-cell receptors sequence reads and quantitatively
characterizes the statistics of receptor generation from both cDNA and gDNA. It
probabilistically annotates sequences and its modular structure can investigate
models of increasing biological complexity for different organisms. For B-cells
IGoR returns the hypermutation statistics, which we use to reveal
co-localization of hypermutations along the sequence. We demonstrate that IGoR
outperforms existing tools in accuracy and estimate the sample sizes needed for
reliable repertoire characterization.

    <title>Exemplar or Matching: Modeling DCJ Problems with Unequal Content Genome
  Data</title>
    <summary>  The edit distance under the DCJ model can be computed in linear time for
genomes with equal content or with Indels. But it becomes NP-Hard in the
presence of duplications, a problem largely unsolved especially when Indels are
considered. In this paper, we compare two mainstream methods to deal with
duplications and associate them with Indels: one by deletion, namely
DCJ-Indel-Exemplar distance; versus the other by gene matching, namely
DCJ-Indel-Matching distance. We design branch-and-bound algorithms with set of
optimization methods to compute exact distances for both. Furthermore, median
problems are discussed in alignment with both of these distance methods, which
are to find a median genome that minimizes distances between itself and three
given genomes. Lin-Kernighan (LK) heuristic is leveraged and powered up by
sub-graph decomposition and search space reduction technologies to handle
median computation. A wide range of experiments are conducted on synthetic data
sets and real data sets to show pros and cons of these two distance metrics per
se, as well as putting them in the median computation scenario.

    <title>Genetic control of plasticity of oil yield for combined abiotic stresses
  using a joint approach of crop modeling and genome-wide association</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity is crucial for
predicting and managing climate change effects on wild plants and crops. Here,
we combined crop modeling and quantitative genetics to study the genetic
control of oil yield plasticity for multiple abiotic stresses in sunflower.
  First we developed stress indicators to characterize 14 environments for
three abiotic stresses (cold, drought and nitrogen) using the SUNFLO crop model
and phenotypic variations of three commercial varieties. The computed plant
stress indicators better explain yield variation than descriptors at the
climatic or crop levels. In those environments, we observed oil yield of 317
sunflower hybrids and regressed it with three selected stress indicators. The
slopes of cold stress norm reaction were used as plasticity phenotypes in the
following genome-wide association study.
  Among the 65,534 tested SNP, we identified nine QTL controlling oil yield
plasticity to cold stress. Associated SNP are localized in genes previously
shown to be involved in cold stress responses: oligopeptide transporters, LTP,
cystatin, alternative oxidase, or root development. This novel approach opens
new perspectives to identify genomic regions involved in
genotype-by-environment interaction of a complex traits to multiple stresses in
realistic natural or agronomical conditions.

    <title>Controllability analysis and control synthesis for the ribosome flow
  model</title>
    <summary>  The ribosomal density along the coding region of the mRNA molecule affect
various fundamental intracellular phenomena including: protein production
rates, organismal fitness, ribosomal drop off, and co-translational protein
folding. Thus, regulating translation in order to obtain a desired ribosomal
profile along the mRNA molecule is an important biological problem. We study
this problem using a model for mRNA translation, called the ribosome flow model
(RFM). In the RFM, the mRNA molecule is modeled as chain of n sites. The n
state-variables describe the ribosomal density profile along the mRNA molecule,
whereas the transition rates from each site to the next are controlled by n+1
positive constants. To study the problem of controlling the density profile, we
consider some or all of the transition rates as time-varying controls. We
consider the following problem: given an initial and a desired ribosomal
density profile, determine the time-varying values of the transition rates that
steer the RFM to this density profile, if they exist. Specifically, we consider
two control problems. In the first, all transition rates can be regulated and
the goal is to steer the ribosomal density profile and the protein production
rate from a given initial value to a desired value. In the second, a single
transition rate is controlled and the goal is to steer the production rate to a
desired value. In the first case, we show that the system is controllable, i.e.
the control is powerful enough to steer the RFM to any desired value, and we
provide closed-form expressions for constant control functions (or transition
rates) asymptotically steering the RFM to the desired value. For the second
problem, we show that the production rate can be steered to any desired value
in a feasible region determined by the other, constant transition rates. We
discuss some of the biological implications of these results.

    <title>Genetic load makes cancer cells more sensitive to common drugs: evidence
  from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia</title>
    <summary>  Genetic alterations initiate tumors and enable the evolution of drug
resistance. The pro-cancer view of mutations is however incomplete, and several
studies show that mutational load can reduce tumor fitness. Given its negative
effect, genetic load should make tumors more sensitive to anticancer drugs.
Here, we test this hypothesis across all major types of cancer from the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia, which provides genetic and expression data of 496 cell
lines together with their response to 24 common anticancer drugs. We found that
the efficacy of 9 out of 24 drugs showed significant association with genetic
load in a pan-cancer analysis. The associations for some tissue-drug
combinations were remarkably strong, with genetic load explaining up to 83% of
the variance in the drug response. Overall, the role of genetic load depended
on both the drug and the tissue type with 10 tissues being particularly
vulnerable to genetic load. We also identified changes in gene expression
associated with increased genetic load, which included cell-cycle checkpoints,
DNA damage and apoptosis. Our results show that genetic load is an important
component of tumor fitness and can predict drug sensitivity. Beyond being a
biomarker, genetic load might be a new, unexplored vulnerability of cancer.

    <title>Estimating Sequence Similarity from Read Sets for Clustering
  Next-Generation Sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  To cluster sequences given only their read-set representations, one may try
to reconstruct each one from the corresponding read set, and then employ
conventional (dis)similarity measures such as the edit distance on the
assembled sequences. This approach is however problematic and we propose
instead to estimate the similarities directly from the read sets. Our approach
is based on an adaptation of the Monge-Elkan similarity known from the field of
databases. It avoids the NP-hard problem of sequence assembly. For low coverage
data it results in a better approximation of the true sequence similarities and
consequently in better clustering, in comparison to the
first-assemble-then-cluster approach.

    <title>DeepGO: Predicting protein functions from sequence and interactions
  using a deep ontology-aware classifier</title>
    <summary>  A large number of protein sequences are becoming available through the
application of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies. Experimental
functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive,
and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms.
Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this
gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO),
which contains over 40,000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple
functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label
problem.
  We have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence.
We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a
cross-species protein-protein interaction network. Our approach specifically
outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies
between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning
model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the
Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a
significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, with significant
improvement for predicting cellular locations.

    <title>DeepMetabolism: A Deep Learning System to Predict Phenotype from Genome
  Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Life science is entering a new era of petabyte-level sequencing data.
Converting such big data to biological insights represents a huge challenge for
computational analysis. To this end, we developed DeepMetabolism, a
biology-guided deep learning system to predict cell phenotypes from
transcriptomics data. By integrating unsupervised pre-training with supervised
training, DeepMetabolism is able to predict phenotypes with high accuracy
(PCC&gt;0.92), high speed (&lt;30 min for &gt;100 GB data using a single GPU), and high
robustness (tolerate up to 75% noise). We envision DeepMetabolism to bridge the
gap between genotype and phenotype and to serve as a springboard for
applications in synthetic biology and precision medicine.

implements a novel text-mining method capable of ranking genes according to
their association to cancer, based on available biomedical literature on
PubMed. OncoScore can scan the biomedical literature with dynamically updatable
web queries and measure the association to cancer of each gene by considering
their citations. The output of the tool is a score that is measuring the
strength of the association of the genes to cancer at the time of the analysis.
Availability and Implementation: OncoScore is available on GitHub and as an R
package on bioconductor.org. Furthermore, the queries to OncoScore can also be
performed at http://www.galseq.com/oncoscore.html Contact:

    <title>Joint estimation of genetic and parent-of-origin effects using RNA-seq
  data from human</title>
    <summary>  RNA sequencing allows one to study allelic imbalance of gene expression,
which may be due to genetic factors or genomic imprinting. It is desirable to
model both genetic and parent-of-origin effects simultaneously to avoid
confounding and to improve the power to detect either effect. In a study of
experimental cross, separation of genetic and parent-of-origin effects can be
achieved by studying reciprocal cross of two inbred strains. In contrast, this
task is much more challenging for an outbred population such as human
population. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework to combine
experimental strategies and novel statistical methods. Specifically, we propose
to collect genotype data from family trios as well as RNA-seq data from the
children of family trios. We have developed a new statistical method to
estimate both genetic and parent-of-origin effects from such data sets. We
demonstrated this approach by studying 30 trios of HapMap samples. Our results
support some of previous finding of imprinted genes and also recover new
candidate imprinted genes.

    <title>MotifMark: Finding Regulatory Motifs in DNA Sequences</title>
    <summary>  The interaction between proteins and DNA is a key driving force in a
significant number of biological processes such as transcriptional regulation,
repair, recombination, splicing, and DNA modification. The identification of
DNA-binding sites and the specificity of target proteins in binding to these
regions are two important steps in understanding the mechanisms of these
biological activities. A number of high-throughput technologies have recently
emerged that try to quantify the affinity between proteins and DNA motifs.
Despite their success, these technologies have their own limitations and fall
short in precise characterization of motifs, and as a result, require further
downstream analysis to extract useful and interpretable information from a
haystack of noisy and inaccurate data. Here we propose MotifMark, a new
algorithm based on graph theory and machine learning, that can find binding
sites on candidate probes and rank their specificity in regard to the
underlying transcription factor. We developed a pipeline to analyze
experimental data derived from compact universal protein binding microarrays
and benchmarked it against two of the most accurate motif search methods. Our
results indicate that MotifMark can be a viable alternative technique for
prediction of motif from protein binding microarrays and possibly other related
high-throughput techniques.

    <title>BNP-Seq: Bayesian Nonparametric Differential Expression Analysis of
  Sequencing Count Data</title>
    <summary>  We perform differential expression analysis of high-throughput sequencing
count data under a Bayesian nonparametric framework, removing sophisticated
ad-hoc pre-processing steps commonly required in existing algorithms. We
propose to use the gamma (beta) negative binomial process, which takes into
account different sequencing depths using sample-specific negative binomial
probability (dispersion) parameters, to detect differentially expressed genes
by comparing the posterior distributions of gene-specific negative binomial
dispersion (probability) parameters. These model parameters are inferred by
borrowing statistical strength across both the genes and samples. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world RNA sequencing count data show
that the proposed differential expression analysis algorithms clearly
outperform previously proposed ones in terms of the areas under both the
receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves.

    <title>Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues</title>
    <summary>  Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape
tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain
contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues
do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between
the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii)
the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein
across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to
estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources
of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the
mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The
reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial
measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial
across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible
across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional
regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from
mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution
of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.

    <title>A generalized linear model for decomposing cis-regulatory,
  parent-of-origin, and maternal effects on allele-specific gene expression</title>
    <summary>  Joint quantification of genetic and epigenetic effects on gene expression is
important for understanding the establishment of complex gene regulation
systems in living organisms. In particular, genomic imprinting and maternal
effects play important roles in the developmental process of mammals and
flowering plants. However, the influence of these effects on gene expression
are difficult to quantify because they act simultaneously with cis-regulatory
mutations. Here we propose a simple method to decompose cis-regulatory (i.e.,
allelic genotype, AG), genomic imprinting (i.e., parent-of-origin, PO), and
maternal (i.e., maternal genotype, MG) effects on allele-specific gene
expression using RNA-seq data obtained from reciprocal crosses. We evaluated
the efficiency of method using a simulated dataset and applied the method to
whole-body Drosophila and mouse trophoblast stem cell (TSC) and liver RNA-seq
data. Consistent with previous studies, we found little evidence of PO and MG
effects in adult Drosophila samples. In contrast, we identified dozens and
hundreds of mouse genes with significant PO and MG effects, respectively.
Interestingly, a similar number of genes with significant PO effect were detect
in mouse TSCs and livers, whereas more genes with significant MG effect were
observed in livers. Further application of this method will clarify how these
three effects influence gene expression levels in different tissues and
developmental stages, and provide novel insight into the evolution of gene
expression regulation.

    <title>On the ability to reconstruct ancestral genomes from Mycobacterium genus</title>
    <summary>  Technical signs of progress during the last decades has led to a situation in
which the accumulation of genome sequence data is increasingly fast and cheap.
The huge amount of molecular data available nowadays can help addressing new
and essential questions in Evolution. However, reconstructing evolution of DNA
sequences requires models, algorithms, statistical and computational methods of
ever increasing complexity. Since most dramatic genomic changes are caused by
genome rearrangements (gene duplications, gain/loss events), it becomes crucial
to understand their mechanisms and reconstruct ancestors of the given genomes.
This problem is known to be NP-complete even in the "simplest" case of three
genomes. Heuristic algorithms are usually executed to provide approximations of
the exact solution.
  We state that, even if the ancestral reconstruction problem is NP-hard in
theory, its exact resolution is feasible in various situations, encompassing
organelles and some bacteria. Such accurate reconstruction, which identifies
too some highly homoplasic mutations whose ancestral status is undecidable,
will be initiated in this work-in-progress, to reconstruct ancestral genomes of
two Mycobacterium pathogenetic bacterias. By mixing automatic reconstruction of
obvious situations with human interventions on signaled problematic cases, we
will indicate that it should be possible to achieve a concrete, complete, and
really accurate reconstruction of lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex. Thus, it is possible to investigate how these genomes have evolved
from their last common ancestors.

    <title>Network-based coverage of mutational profiles reveals cancer genes</title>
    <summary>  A central goal in cancer genomics is to identify the somatic alterations that
underpin tumor initiation and progression. This task is challenging as the
mutational profiles of cancer genomes exhibit vast heterogeneity, with many
alterations observed within each individual, few shared somatically mutated
genes across individuals, and important roles in cancer for both frequently and
infrequently mutated genes. While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily
identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to
distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. Here,
we introduce a method that considers per-individual mutational profiles within
the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small
connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated,
comprise pathways that are perturbed across (i.e., "cover") a large fraction of
the individuals. We devise a simple yet intuitive objective function that
balances identifying a small subset of genes with covering a large fraction of
individuals. We show how to solve this problem optimally using integer linear
programming and also give a fast heuristic algorithm that works well in
practice. We perform a large-scale evaluation of our resulting method, nCOP, on
6,038 TCGA tumor samples across 24 different cancer types. We demonstrate that
our approach nCOP is more effective in identifying cancer genes than both
methods that do not utilize any network information as well as state-of-the-art
network-based methods that aggregate mutational information across individuals.
Overall, our work demonstrates the power of combining per-individual mutational
information with interaction networks in order to uncover genes functionally
relevant in cancers, and in particular those genes that are less frequently
mutated.

    <title>Reconstructing antibody repertoires from error-prone immunosequencing
  datasets</title>
    <summary>  Transforming error-prone immunosequencing datasets into antibody repertoires
is a fundamental problem in immunogenomics, and a prerequisite for studies of
immune responses. Although various repertoire reconstruction algorithms were
released in the last three years, it remains unclear how to benchmark them and
how to assess the accuracy of the reconstructed repertoires. We describe a
novel IgReC algorithm for constructing antibody repertoires from
high-throughput immunosequencing datasets and a new framework for assessing the
quality of reconstructed repertoires. Benchmarking IgReC against the existing
antibody repertoire reconstruction tools has demonstrated that it results in
highly accurate repertoire reconstructions. Surprisingly, antibody repertoires
constructed by IgReC from barcoded immunosequencing datasets in blind mode
(without using unique molecular identifiers information) improved upon the
repertoires constructed by the state-of-the-art tools that use barcoding. This
finding suggests that IgReC may alleviate the need to generate repertoires
using the barcoding technology (the workhorse of current immunogenomics
efforts) because our computational approach to error correction of
immunosequencing data ends up being nearly as powerful as the experimental
approach based on barcoding.

    <title>Efficient and accurate causal inference with hidden confounders from
  genome-transcriptome variation data</title>
    <summary>  Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing
and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of
genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr
for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using
cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods
by taking into account hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr
outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on
the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human
lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is
publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr

    <title>Aligning coding sequences with frameshift extension penalties</title>
    <summary>  Frameshift translation is an important phenomenon that contributes to the
appearance of novel Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) and functions in gene evolution,
by allowing alternative amino acid translations of genes coding regions.
Frameshift translations can be identified by aligning two CDS, from a same gene
or from homologous genes, while accounting for their codon structure. Two main
classes of algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem of aligning CDS,
either by amino acid sequence alignment back-translation, or by simultaneously
accounting for the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The former does not allow
to account for frameshift translations and up to now, the latter exclusively
accounts for frameshift translation initiation, not accounting for the length
of the translation disruption caused by a frameshift.
  Here, we introduce a new scoring scheme with an algorithm for the pairwise
alignment of CDS accounting for frameshift translation initiation and length,
while simultaneously accounting for nucleotide and amino acid sequences. We
compare the method to other CDS alignment methods based on an application to
the comparison of pairs of CDS from homologous \emph{human}, \emph{mouse} and
\emph{cow} genes of ten mammalian gene families from the Ensembl-Compara
database. The results show that our method is particularly robust to parameter
changes as compared to existing methods. It also appears to be a good
compromise, performing well both in the presence and absence of frameshift
translations between the CDS. An implementation of the method is available at
https://github.com/UdeS-CoBIUS/FsePSA.

    <title>Data-Driven Prediction of CRISPR-Based Transcription Regulation for
  Programmable Control of Metabolic Flux</title>
    <summary>  Multiplex and multi-directional control of metabolic pathways is crucial for
metabolic engineering to improve product yield of fuels, chemicals, and
pharmaceuticals. To achieve this goal, artificial transcriptional regulators
such as CRISPR-based transcription regulators have been developed to
specifically activate or repress genes of interest. Here, we found that by
deploying guide RNAs to target on DNA sites at different locations of genetic
cassettes, we could use just one synthetic CRISPR-based transcriptional
regulator to simultaneously activate and repress gene expressions. By using the
pairwise datasets of guide RNAs and gene expressions, we developed a
data-driven predictive model to rationally design this system for fine-tuning
expression of target genes. We demonstrated that this system could achieve
programmable control of metabolic fluxes when using yeast to produce versatile
chemicals. We anticipate that this master CRISPR-based transcription regulator
will be a valuable addition to the synthetic biology toolkit for metabolic
engineering, speeding up the design-build-test cycle in industrial
biomanufacturing as well as generating new biological insights on the fates of
eukaryotic cells.

    <title>OncoScore: a novel, Internet-based tool to assess the oncogenic
  potential of genes</title>
    <summary>  The complicated, evolving landscape of cancer mutations poses a formidable
challenge to identify cancer genes among the large lists of mutations typically
generated in NGS experiments. The ability to prioritize these variants is
therefore of paramount importance. To address this issue we developed
OncoScore, a text-mining tool that ranks genes according to their association
with cancer, based on available biomedical literature. Receiver operating
characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) metrics on manually
curated datasets confirmed the excellent discriminating capability of OncoScore
(OncoScore cut-off threshold = 21.09; AUC = 90.3%, 95% CI: 88.1-92.5%),
indicating that OncoScore provides useful results in cases where an efficient
prioritization of cancer-associated genes is needed.

    <title>Finding the centre: corrections for asymmetry in high-throughput
  sequencing datasets</title>
    <summary>  High throughput sequencing is a technology that allows for the generation of
millions of reads of genomic data regarding a study of interest, and data from
high throughput sequencing platforms are usually count compositions. Subsequent
analysis of such data can yield information on tran- scription profiles,
microbial diversity, or even relative cellular abundance in culture. Because of
the high cost of acquisition, the data are usually sparse, and always contain
far fewer observations than variables. However, an under-appreciated pathology
of these data are their often unbalanced nature: i.e, there is often systematic
variation between groups simply due to presence or absence of features, and
this variation is important to the biological interpretation of the data. A
simple example would be comparing transcriptomes of yeast cells with and
without a gene knockout. This causes samples in the comparison groups to
exhibit widely varying centres. This work extends a previously described
log-ratio transformation method that allows for variable comparisons between
samples in a Bayesian compositional context. We demonstrate the pathology in
modelled and real unbalanced experimental designs to show how this dramatically
causes both false negative and false positive inference. We then introduce
several approaches to demonstrate how the pathologies can be addressed. An
extreme example is presented where only the use of a predefined basis is
appropriate. The transformations are implemented as an extension to a general
compositional data analysis tool known as ALDEx2 which is available on
Bioconductor.

    <title>Evidence-based gene models for structural and functional annotations of
  the oil palm genome</title>
    <summary>  The advent of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing has led to an explosion of
data waiting to be transformed into knowledge about genome organization and
function. Gene prediction is customarily the starting point for genome
analysis. This paper presents a bioinformatics study of the oil palm genome,
including comparative genomics analysis, database and tools development, and
mining of biological data for genes of interest. We have annotated 26,059 oil
palm genes integrated from two independent gene-prediction pipelines, Fgenesh++
and Seqping. This integrated annotation constitutes a significant improvement
in comparison to the preliminary annotation published in 2013. We conducted a
comprehensive analysis of intronless, resistance and fatty acid biosynthesis
genes, and demonstrated that the high quality of the current genome annotation.
3,658 intronless genes were identified in the oil palm genome, an important
resource for evolutionary study. Further analysis of the oil palm genes
revealed 210 candidate resistance genes involved in pathogen defense. Fatty
acids have diverse applications ranging from food to industrial feedstocks, and
we identified 42 key genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in oil palm.
These results provide an important resource for studies of plant genomes and a
theoretical foundation for marker-assisted breeding of oil palm and related
crops.

    <title>ASB1 differential methylation in ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Relationship
  with left ventricular performance in end stage heart failure patients</title>
    <summary>  Aims: Ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) leads to impaired contraction and
ventricular dysfunction causing high rates of morbidity and mortality.
Epigenomics allows the identification of epigenetic signatures in human
diseases. We analyse the differential epigenetic patterns of ASB gene family in
ICM patients and relate these alterations to their haemodynamic and functional
status. Methods and Results: Epigenomic analysis was carried out using 16 left
ventricular (LV) tissue samples, 8 from ICM patients undergoing heart
transplantation and 8 from control (CNT) subjects without cardiac disease. We
increased the sample size up to 13 ICM and 10 CNT for RNA-sequencing and to 14
ICM for pyrosequencing analyses. We found a hypermethylated profile
(cg11189868) in the ASB1 gene that showed a differential methylation of 0.26
beta difference, P &lt; 0.05. This result was validated by pyrosequencing
technique (0.23 beta difference, P &lt; 0.05). Notably, the methylation pattern
was strongly related to LV ejection fraction (r = -0.849, P = 0.008) stroke
volume (r = -0.929, P = 0.001) and end-systolic and diastolic LV diameters (r =
-0.743, P = 0.035 for both). ASB1 showed a down regulation in mRNA levels (-1.2
fold, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings link a specific ASB1 methylation
pattern to LV structure and performance in end-stage ICM, opening new
therapeutic opportunities and providing new insights regarding which is the
functionally relevant genome in the ischemic failing myocardium. Keywords:
ischaemic cardiomyopathy; epigenomics; heart failure; left ventricular
dysfunction; stroke volume; ASB1.

    <title>Comparative genomic analysis of the human gut microbiome reveals a broad
  distribution of metabolic pathways for the degradation of host-synthetized
  mucin glycans</title>
    <summary>  The colonic mucus layer is a dynamic and complex structure formed by secreted
and transmembrane mucins, which are high-molecular-weight and heavily
glycosylated proteins. Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a
dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various
representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus
can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are
not sufficiently available. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to
identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to
monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides.
Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans
were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, whereas genes for the catabolism of
derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (ii)
Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the
monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of
monosaccharide transporters. (iii) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes
may be involved in exchange pathways for the monosaccharides derived from
cleaved mucin glycans. (iv) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different
abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at
least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes.
(v) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that
are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired
organisms alone. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into
the inter-microbial communications of the HGM as well as into host-HGM
interactions.

    <title>Meraculous-2D: Haplotype-sensitive Assembly of Highly Heterozygous
  genomes</title>
    <summary>  While many short read assemblers attempt to simplify the de Brujin graph by
identifying and resolving variant-induced bubbles to produce a haploid mosaic
result, this approach is only viable when variants are relatively rare and the
bubbles are well defined in a graph context. We observed that diploid genomes
with very high levels of heterozygosity fail to display well-resolved bubble
structures in a typical assembly graph and thus result in highly fragmented and
incomplete assemblies. Here we present an enhancement of Meraculous2 algorithm,
called Meraculous-2D, which preserves haplotypes across variant sites and
generates accurate assembly of highly heterozygous diploid genomes. Preserving
and taking advantage of the allelic variation throughout the assembly process
allows reconstructing both haplomes at once, without the need to pick arbitrary
paths through bubble structures. We also enhanced the original diploidy
resolution method of Meraculous2 to maintain and report phased haplotype
variant information.

    <title>Family-specific scaling laws in bacterial genomes</title>
    <summary>  Among several quantitative invariants found in evolutionary genomics, one of
the most striking is the scaling of the overall abundance of proteins, or
protein domains, sharing a specific functional annotation across genomes of
given size. The size of these functional categories change, on average, as
power-laws in the total number of protein-coding genes. Here, we show that such
regularities are not restricted to the overall behavior of high-level
functional categories, but also exist systematically at the level of single
evolutionary families of protein domains. Specifically, the number of proteins
within each family follows family-specific scaling laws with genome size.
Functionally similar sets of families tend to follow similar scaling laws, but
this is not always the case. To understand this systematically, we provide a
comprehensive classification of families based on their scaling properties.
Additionally, we develop a quantitative score for the heterogeneity of the
scaling of families belonging to a given category or predefined group. Under
the common reasonable assumption that selection is driven solely or mainly by
biological function, these findings point to fine-tuned and interdependent
functional roles of specific protein domains, beyond our current functional
annotations. This analysis provides a deeper view on the links between
evolutionary expansion of protein families and the functional constraints
shaping the gene repertoire of bacterial genomes.

    <title>Anchor points for genome alignment based on Filtered Spaced Word Matches</title>
    <summary>  Alignment of large genomic sequences is a fundamental task in computational
genome analysis. Most methods for genomic alignment use high-scoring local
alignments as {\em anchor points} to reduce the search space of the alignment
procedure. Speed and quality of these methods therefore depend on the
underlying anchor points. Herein, we propose to use {\em Filtered Spaced Word
Matches} to calculate anchor points for genome alignment. To evaluate this
approach, we used these anchor points in the the widely used alignment pipeline
{\em Mugsy}. For distantly related sequence sets, we could substantially
improve the quality of alignments produced by {\em Mugsy}.

    <title>Recent advancement in Next Generation Sequencing techniques and its
  computational analysis</title>
    <summary>  Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a recently evolved technology, have served
a lot in the research and development sector of our society. This novel
approach is a newbie and has critical advantages over the traditional Capillary
Electrophoresis (CE) based Sanger Sequencing. The advancement of NGS has led to
numerous important discoveries, which could have been costlier and time taking
in case of traditional CE based Sanger sequencing. NGS methods are highly
parallelized enabling to sequence thousands to millions of molecules
simultaneously. This technology results into huge amount of data, which need to
be analysed to conclude valuable information. Specific data analysis algorithms
are written for specific task to be performed. The algorithms in group, act as
a tool in analysing the NGS data. Analysis of NGS data unravels important clues
in quest for the treatment of various life-threatening diseases; improved crop
varieties and other related scientific problems related to human welfare. In
this review, an effort was made to address basic background of NGS
technologies, possible applications, computational approaches and tools
involved in NGS data analysis, future opportunities and challenges in the area.

    <title>Development and characterization of Brassica juncea fruticulosa
  introgression lines exhibiting resistance to mustard aphid</title>
    <summary>  Background: Mustard aphid is a major pest of Brassica oilseeds. No source for
aphid resistance is presently available in Brassica juncea . A wild crucifer,
Brassica fruticulosa is known to be resistant to mustard aphid. An artificially
synthesized amphiploid, AD-4 (B. fruticulosa x B. rapa var. brown sarson) was
developed for use as a bridge species to transfer fruticulosa resistance to B.
juncea. Using the selfed backcross we could select a large number of lines with
resistance to mustard aphid. This paper reports cytogenetic stability of
introgression lines, molecular evidence for alien introgression and their
reaction to mustard aphid infestation. Results: Majority of introgression lines
had expected euploid chromosome number(2n= 36), showed normal meiosis and high
pollen grain fertility. Well-distributed and transferable simple-sequence
repeats (SSR) markers for all the 18 B. juncea chromosomes helped to
characterize introgression events. Average proportions of recipient and donor
genome in the substitution lines were 49.72 and 35.06%, respectively. Minimum
alien parent genome presence (27.29%) was observed in the introgression line,
Ad3K-280 . Introgressed genotypes also varied for their resistance responses to
mustard aphid infestations under artificial release conditions for two
continuous seasons. Some of the test genotypes showed consistent resistant
reaction. Conclusions: B.juncea-fruticulosa introgression set may prove to be a
very powerful breeding tool for aphid resistance related QTL/gene discovery and
fine mapping of the desired genes/QTLs to facilitate marker assisted transfer
of identified gene(s) for mustard aphid resistance in the background of
commercial mustard genotypes.

    <title>Insular microbiogeography</title>
    <summary>  The diversity revealed by large scale genomics in microbiology is calling
into question long held beliefs about genome stability, evolutionary rate, even
the definition of a species. MacArthur and Wilson's theory of insular
biogeography provides an explanation for the diversity of macroscopic animal
and plant species as a consequence of the associated hierarchical web of
species interdependence. We report a large scale study of microbial diversity
that reveals that the cumulative number of genes discovered increases with the
number of genomes studied as a simple power law. This result is demonstrated
for three different genera comparing over 15,000 isolates. We show that this
power law is formally related to the MacArthur-Wilson exponent, suggesting the
emerging diversity of microbial genotypes arises because the scale independent
behavior first reported by MacArthur and Wilson extends down to the scale of
microbes and their genes. Assessing the depth of available whole genome
sequences implies a dynamically changing core genome, suggesting that
traditional taxonomic classifications should be replaced with a quasispecies
model that captures the diversity and dynamic exchange of genes. We report
Species population "clouds" in a defined microbiome, with scale invariance
extending down to the level of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

    <title>MapReduce Algorithms for Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks from
  Time-Series Microarray Data Using an Information-Theoretic Approach</title>
    <summary>  Gene regulation is a series of processes that control gene expression and its
extent. The connections among genes and their regulatory molecules, usually
transcription factors, and a descriptive model of such connections, are known
as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Elucidating GRNs is crucial to understand
the inner workings of the cell and the complexity of gene interactions. To
date, numerous algorithms have been developed to infer gene regulatory
networks. However, as the number of identified genes increases and the
complexity of their interactions is uncovered, networks and their regulatory
mechanisms become cumbersome to test. Furthermore, prodding through
experimental results requires an enormous amount of computation, resulting in
slow data processing. Therefore, new approaches are needed to expeditiously
analyze copious amounts of experimental data resulting from cellular GRNs. To
meet this need, cloud computing is promising as reported in the literature.
Here we propose new MapReduce algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks
on a Hadoop cluster in a cloud environment. These algorithms employ an
information-theoretic approach to infer GRNs using time-series microarray data.
Experimental results show that our MapReduce program is much faster than an
existing tool while achieving slightly better prediction accuracy than the
existing tool.

    <title>A log-linear time algorithm for constrained changepoint detection</title>
    <summary>  Changepoint detection is a central problem in time series and genomic data.
For some applications, it is natural to impose constraints on the directions of
changes. One example is ChIP-seq data, for which adding an up-down constraint
improves peak detection accuracy, but makes the optimization problem more
complicated. We show how a recently proposed functional pruning technique can
be adapted to solve such constrained changepoint detection problems. This leads
to a new algorithm which can solve problems with arbitrary affine constraints
on adjacent segment means, and which has empirical time complexity that is
log-linear in the amount of data. This algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in a benchmark of several genomic data sets, and is orders of
magnitude faster than existing algorithms that have similar accuracy. Our
implementation is available as the PeakSegPDPA function in the coseg R package,

    <title>Algorithmic Methods to Infer the Evolutionary Trajectories in Cancer
  Progression</title>
    <summary>  The genomic evolution inherent to cancer relates directly to a renewed focus
on the voluminous next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and machine learning
for the inference of explanatory models of how the (epi)genomic events are
choreographed in cancer initiation and development. However, despite the
increasing availability of multiple additional -omics data, this quest has been
frustrated by various theoretical and technical hurdles, mostly stemming from
the dramatic heterogeneity of the disease. In this paper, we build on our
recent works on "selective advantage" relation among driver mutations in cancer
progression and investigate its applicability to the modeling problem at the
population level. Here, we introduce PiCnIc (Pipeline for Cancer Inference), a
versatile, modular and customizable pipeline to extract ensemble-level
progression models from cross-sectional sequenced cancer genomes. The pipeline
has many translational implications as it combines state-of-the-art techniques
for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of
fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations and progression model inference. We
demonstrate PiCnIc's ability to reproduce much of the current knowledge on
colorectal cancer progression, as well as to suggest novel experimentally
verifiable hypotheses.

    <title>Essential role of long non-coding RNAs in de novo chromatin
  modifications: The genomic address code hypothesis</title>
    <summary>  The epigenome, i.e. the whole of chromatin modifications, is transferred from
mother to daughter cells during cell differentiation. When de novo chromatin
modifications (establishment or erasure of, respectively, new or pre-existing
DNA methylations and/or histone modifications) are made in a daughter cell,
however, it has a different epigenome than its mother cell. Although de novo
chromatin modifications are an important event that comprises elementary
processes of cell differentiation, its molecular mechanism remains poorly
understood. We argue in this Letter that a key to solving this problem lies in
understanding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)- a type of RNA that is
becoming increasingly prominent in epigenetic studies. Many studies show that
lncRNAs form ribonucleo-protein complexes in the nucleus and are involved in
chromatin modifications. However, chromatin-modifying enzymes lack the
information about genomic positions on which they act. It is known, on the
other hand, that a single-stranded RNA in general can bind to a double-stranded
DNA to form a triple helix. If each lncRNA forms a ribonucleo-protein complex
with chromatin-modifying enzymes on one hand and, at the same time, a triple
helix with a genomic region based on its specific nucleotide sequence on the
other hand, it can induce de novo chromatin modifications at specific sites.
Thus, the great variety of lncRNAs can be explained by the requirement for the
diversity of "genomic address codes" specific to their cognate genomic regions
where de novo chromatin modifications take place.

    <title>Network-based Distance Metric with Application to Discover Disease
  Subtypes in Cancer</title>
    <summary>  While we once thought of cancer as single monolithic diseases affecting a
specific organ site, we now understand that there are many subtypes of cancer
defined by unique patterns of gene mutations. These gene mutational data, which
can be more reliably obtained than gene expression data, help to determine how
the subtypes develop, evolve, and respond to therapies. Different from dense
continuous-value gene expression data, which most existing cancer subtype
discovery algorithms use, somatic mutational data are extremely sparse and
heterogeneous, because there are less than 0.5\% mutated genes in discrete
value 1/0 out of 20,000 human protein-coding genes, and identical mutated genes
are rarely shared by cancer patients.
  Our focus is to search for cancer subtypes from extremely sparse and high
dimensional gene mutational data in discrete 1 and 0 values using unsupervised
learning. We propose a new network-based distance metric. We project cancer
patients' mutational profile into their gene network structure and measure the
distance between two patients using the similarity between genes and between
the gene vertexes of the patients in the network. Experimental results in
synthetic data and real-world data show that our approach outperforms the top
competitors in cancer subtype discovery. Furthermore, our approach can identify
cancer subtypes that cannot be detected by other clustering algorithms in real
cancer data.

    <title>Selection of training populations (and other subset selection problems)
  with an accelerated genetic algorithm (STPGA: An R-package for selection of
  training populations with a genetic algorithm)</title>
    <summary>  Optimal subset selection is an important task that has numerous algorithms
designed for it and has many application areas. STPGA contains a special
genetic algorithm supplemented with a tabu memory property (that keeps track of
previously tried solutions and their fitness for a number of iterations), and
with a regression of the fitness of the solutions on their coding that is used
to form the ideal estimated solution (look ahead property) to search for
solutions of generic optimal subset selection problems. I have initially
developed the programs for the specific problem of selecting training
populations for genomic prediction or association problems, therefore I give
discussion of the theory behind optimal design of experiments to explain the
default optimization criteria in STPGA, and illustrate the use of the programs
in this endeavor. Nevertheless, I have picked a few other areas of application:
supervised and unsupervised variable selection based on kernel alignment,
supervised variable selection with design criteria, influential observation
identification for regression, solving mixed integer quadratic optimization
problems, balancing gains and inbreeding in a breeding population. Some of
these illustrations pertain new statistical approaches.

    <title>Bayesian Boolean Matrix Factorisation</title>
    <summary>  Boolean matrix factorisation aims to decompose a binary data matrix into an
approximate Boolean product of two low rank, binary matrices: one containing
meaningful patterns, the other quantifying how the observations can be
expressed as a combination of these patterns. We introduce the OrMachine, a
probabilistic generative model for Boolean matrix factorisation and derive a
Metropolised Gibbs sampler that facilitates efficient parallel posterior
inference. On real world and simulated data, our method outperforms all
currently existing approaches for Boolean matrix factorisation and completion.
This is the first method to provide full posterior inference for Boolean Matrix
factorisation which is relevant in applications, e.g. for controlling false
positive rates in collaborative filtering and, crucially, improves the
interpretability of the inferred patterns. The proposed algorithm scales to
large datasets as we demonstrate by analysing single cell gene expression data
in 1.3 million mouse brain cells across 11 thousand genes on commodity
hardware.

    <title>Memory Matching Networks for Genomic Sequence Classification</title>
    <summary>  When analyzing the genome, researchers have discovered that proteins bind to
DNA based on certain patterns of the DNA sequence known as "motifs". However,
it is difficult to manually construct motifs due to their complexity. Recently,
externally learned memory models have proven to be effective methods for
reasoning over inputs and supporting sets. In this work, we present memory
matching networks (MMN) for classifying DNA sequences as protein binding sites.
Our model learns a memory bank of encoded motifs, which are dynamic memory
modules, and then matches a new test sequence to each of the motifs to classify
the sequence as a binding or nonbinding site.

    <title>Epigenome-wide association study and integrative analysis with the
  transcriptome based on GWAS summary statistics</title>
    <summary>  The past decade has seen a rapid growth in omics technologies. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have uncovered susceptibility variants for a variety
of complex traits. However, the functional significance of most discovered
variants are still not fully understood. On the other hand, there is increasing
interest in exploring the role of epigenetic variations such as DNA methylation
in disease pathogenesis. In this work, we present a general framework for
epigenome-wide association study and integrative analysis with the
transcriptome based on GWAS summary statistics and data from methylation and
expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies. The framework is based on
Mendelian randomization, which is much less vulnerable to confounding and
reverse causation compared to conventional studies. The framework was applied
to five complex diseases. We first identified loci that are differentially
methylated due to genetic variations, and then developed several approaches for
joint testing with the GWAS-imputed transcriptome. We discovered a number of
novel candidate genes that are not implicated in the original GWAS studies. We
also observed strong evidence (lowest p = 2.01e-184) for differential
expression among the top genes mapped to methylation loci. The framework
proposed here opens a new way of analyzing GWAS summary data and will be useful
for gaining deeper insight into disease mechanisms.

    <title>Quantification of tumour evolution and heterogeneity via Bayesian
  epiallele detection</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Epigenetic heterogeneity within a tumour can play an important
role in tumour evolution and the emergence of resistance to treatment. It is
increasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along
the genome -- so-called `epialleles' -- offers greater insight into epigenetic
dynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm marks individually.
  Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are
present in multiple regions of the same tumour. We apply our method to reduced
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from multiple regions of one
lung cancer tumour and a matched normal sample. The model borrows information
from all tumour regions to leverage greater statistical power. The total number
of epialleles, the epiallele DNAm patterns, and a noise hyperparameter are all
automatically inferred from the data. Uncertainty as to which epiallele an
observed sequencing read originated from is explicitly incorporated by
marginalising over the appropriate posterior densities. The degree to which
tumour samples are contaminated with normal tissue can be estimated and
corrected for. By tracing the distribution of epialleles throughout the tumour
we can infer the phylogenetic history of the tumour, identify epialleles that
differ between normal and cancer tissue, and define a measure of global
epigenetic disorder.

    <title>iCorr : Complex correlation method to detect origin of replication in
  prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes</title>
    <summary>  Computational prediction of origin of replication (ORI) has been of great
interest in bioinformatics and several methods including GC Skew, Z curve,
auto-correlation etc. have been explored in the past. In this paper, we have
extended the auto-correlation method to predict ORI location with much higher
resolution for prokaryotes. The proposed complex correlation method (iCorr)
converts the genome sequence into a sequence of complex numbers by mapping the
nucleotides to {+1,-1,+i,-i} instead of {+1,-1} used in the auto-correlation
method (here, 'i' is square root of -1). Thus, the iCorr method uses
information about the positions of all the four nucleotides unlike the earlier
auto-correlation method which uses the positional information of only one
nucleotide. Also, this earlier method required visual inspection of the
obtained graphs to identify the location of origin of replication. The proposed
iCorr method does away with this need and is able to identify the origin
location simply by picking the peak in the iCorr graph. The iCorr method also
works for a much smaller segment size compared to the earlier auto-correlation
method, which can be very helpful in experimental validation of the
computational predictions. We have also developed a variant of the iCorr method
to predict ORI location in eukaryotes and have tested it with the
experimentally known origin locations of S. cerevisiae with an average accuracy
of 71.76%.

    <title>Generalized Hultman Numbers and Cycle Structures of Breakpoint Graphs</title>
    <summary>  Genome rearrangements can be modeled as $k$-breaks, which break a genome at k
positions and glue the resulting fragments in a new order. In particular,
reversals, translocations, fusions, and fissions are modeled as $2$-breaks, and
transpositions are modeled as $3$-breaks. While $k$-break rearrangements for
$k&gt;3$ have not been observed in evolution, they are used in cancer genomics to
model chromothripsis, a catastrophic event of multiple breakages happening
simultaneously in a genome. It is known that the $k$-break distance between two
genomes (i.e., the minimum number of $k$-breaks required to transform one
genome into the other) can be computed in terms of cycle lengths in the
breakpoint graph of these genomes.
  In the current work, we address the combinatorial problem of enumerating
genomes at a given $k$-break distance from a fixed unichromosomal genome. More
generally, we enumerate genome pairs, whose breakpoint graph has a given
distribution of cycle lengths. We further show how our enumeration can be used
for uniform sampling of random genomes at a given $k$-break distance, and
describe its connection to various combinatorial objects such as Bell
polynomials.

    <title>Variant tolerant read mapping using min-hashing</title>
    <summary>  DNA read mapping is a ubiquitous task in bioinformatics, and many tools have
been developed to solve the read mapping problem. However, there are two trends
that are changing the landscape of readmapping: First, new sequencing
technologies provide very long reads with high error rates (up to 15%). Second,
many genetic variants in the population are known, so the reference genome is
not considered as a single string over ACGT, but as a complex object containing
these variants. Most existing read mappers do not handle these new
circumstances appropriately.
  We introduce a new read mapper prototype called VATRAM that considers
variants. It is based on Min-Hashing of q-gram sets of reference genome
windows. Min-Hashing is one form of locality sensitive hashing. The variants
are directly inserted into VATRAMs index which leads to a fast mapping process.
Our results show that VATRAM achieves better precision and recall than
state-of-the-art read mappers like BWA under certain cirumstances. VATRAM is
open source and can be accessed at

    <title>Inferring clonal composition from multiple tumor biopsies</title>
    <summary>  Knowledge about the clonal evolution of each tumor can inform
driver-alteration discovery by pointing out initiating genetic events as well
as events that contribute to the selective advantage of proliferative, and
potentially drug-resistant tumor subclones. A necessary building block to the
reconstruction of clonal evolution from tumor profiles is the estimation of the
cellular composition of each tumor subclone cellularity, and these, in turn,
are based on estimates of the relative abundance frequency of subclone-specific
genetic alterations in tumor biopsies. Estimating the frequency of genetic
alterations is complicated by the high genomic instability that characterizes
many tumor types.

    <title>Context-Aware Prediction of Pathogenicity of Missense Mutations Involved
  in Human Disease</title>
    <summary>  Amino-acid substitutions are implicated in a wide range of human diseases,
many of which are lethal. Distinguishing such mutations from polymorphisms
without significant effect on human health is a necessary step in understanding
the etiology of such diseases. Computational methods can be used to select
interesting mutations within a larger set, to corroborate experimental findings
and to elucidate the cause of the deleterious effect. In this work, we show
that taking into account the sequence context in which the mutation appears
allows to improve the predictive and explanatory power of such methods. We
present an unsupervised approach based on the direct-coupling analysis of
homologous proteins. We show its capability to quantify mutations where methods
without context dependence fail. We highlight cases where the context
dependence is interpretable as functional or structural constraints and show
that our simple and unsupervised method has an accuracy similar to
state-of-the-art methods, including supervised ones.

    <title>Factor Models for Cancer Signatures</title>
    <summary>  We present a novel method for extracting cancer signatures by applying
statistical risk models (http://ssrn.com/abstract=2732453) from quantitative
finance to cancer genome data. Using 1389 whole genome sequenced samples from
14 cancers, we identify an "overall" mode of somatic mutational noise. We give
a prescription for factoring out this noise and source code for fixing the
number of signatures. We apply nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to genome
data aggregated by cancer subtype and filtered using our method. The resultant
signatures have substantially lower variability than those from unfiltered
data. Also, the computational cost of signature extraction is cut by about a
factor of 10. We find 3 novel cancer signatures, including a liver cancer
dominant signature (96% contribution) and a renal cell carcinoma signature (70%
contribution). Our method accelerates finding new cancer signatures and
improves their overall stability. Reciprocally, the methods for extracting
cancer signatures could have interesting applications in quantitative finance.

    <title>Excess of genomic defects in a woolly mammoth on Wrangel island</title>
    <summary>  Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) populated Siberia, Beringia, and
North America during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Recent breakthroughs
in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two
specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is
from a mainland population ~45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The
second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on
Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size
more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in
effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral
models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these
previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and
non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify
a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene
sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of
premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent
with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the
dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high
rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these
loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective
pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two
independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat
phenotype in this island woolly mammoth.

    <title>The combinatorics of overlapping genes</title>
    <summary>  Overlapping genes exist in all domains of life and are much more abundant
than expected at their first discovery in the late 1970s. Assuming that the
reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two
reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and in three reading
frames in the opposite strand, denoted by -0, -1 and -2. This motivated
numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on
the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus
in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms
of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints
bind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes.
Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just
single amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping
reading frame -2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame
overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0 (and reciprocally), whereas
specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null
constraints (YY = 0 in frame -2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame +0 &lt;=&gt; Y
in frame -2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable
the characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins. We
describe several formal frameworks and a graph algorithm to characterize and
compute these constraints. These results yield support for understanding the
mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes, and for developing novel
overlapping gene detection methods.

    <title>Screening and merging algorithm for the detection of copy-number
  alterations</title>
    <summary>  We call change-point problem (CPP) the identification of changes in the
probabilistic behavior of a sequence of observations. Solving the CPP involves
detecting the number and position of such changes. In genetics the study of how
and what characteristics of a individual's genetic content might contribute to
the occurrence and evolution of cancer has fundamental importance in the
diagnosis and treatment of such diseases and can be formulated in the framework
of chage-point analysis. In this article we propose a modification to a
existing method of segmentation with the objective of producing a algorithm
that is robust to a variety of sampling distributions and that is adequate for
more recent method of accessing DNA copy-number which might require a
restriction on the minimum length of a altered segment.

    <title>Decomposing the site frequency spectrum: the impact of tree topology on
  neutrality tests</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the dependence of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) on the
topological structure of genealogical trees. We show that basic population
genetic statistics - for instance estimators of $\theta$ or neutrality tests
such as Tajima's $D$ - can be decomposed into components of waiting times
between coalescent events and of tree topology. Our results clarify the
relative impact of the two components on these statistics. We provide a
rigorous interpretation of positive or negative values of an important class of
neutrality tests in terms of the underlying tree shape. In particular, we show
that values of Tajima's $D$ and Fay and Wu's $H$ depend in a direct way on a
peculiar measure of tree balance which is mostly determined by the root balance
of the tree. We present a new test for selection in the same class as Fay and
Wu's $H$ and discuss its interpretation and power. Finally, we determine the
trees corresponding to extreme expected values of these neutrality tests and
present formulae for these extreme values as a function of sample size and
number of segregating sites.

    <title>Predicting the Plant Root-Associated Ecological Niche of 21 Pseudomonas
  Species Using Machine Learning and Metabolic Modeling</title>
    <summary>  Plants rarely occur in isolated systems. Bacteria can inhabit either the
endosphere, the region inside the plant root, or the rhizosphere, the soil
region just outside the plant root. Our goal is to understand if using genomic
data and media dependent metabolic model information is better for training
machine learning of predicting bacterial ecological niche than media
independent models or pure genome based species trees. We considered three
machine learning techniques: support vector machine, non-negative matrix
factorization, and artificial neural networks. In all three machine-learning
approaches, the media-based metabolic models and flux balance analyses were
more effective at predicting bacterial niche than the genome or PRMT models.
Support Vector Machine trained on a minimal media base with Mannose, Proline
and Valine was most predictive of all models and media types with an f-score of
0.8 for rhizosphere and 0.97 for endosphere. Thus we can conclude that
media-based metabolic modeling provides a holistic view of the metabolome,
allowing machine learning algorithms to highlight the differences between and
categorize endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria. There was no single media type
that best highlighted differences between endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria
metabolism and therefore no single enzyme, reaction, or compound that defined
whether a bacteria's origin was of the endosphere or rhizosphere.

    <title>Stratification of patient trajectories using covariate latent variable
  models</title>
    <summary>  Standard models assign disease progression to discrete categories or stages
based on well-characterized clinical markers. However, such a system is
potentially at odds with our understanding of the underlying biology, which in
highly complex systems may support a (near-)continuous evolution of disease
from inception to terminal state. To learn such a continuous disease score one
could infer a latent variable from dynamic "omics" data such as RNA-seq that
correlates with an outcome of interest such as survival time. However, such
analyses may be confounded by additional data such as clinical covariates
measured in electronic health records (EHRs). As a solution to this we
introduce covariate latent variable models, a novel type of latent variable
model that learns a low-dimensional data representation in the presence of two
(asymmetric) views of the same data source. We apply our model to TCGA
colorectal cancer RNA-seq data and demonstrate how incorporating
microsatellite-instability (MSI) status as an external covariate allows us to
identify genes that stratify patients on an immune-response trajectory.
Finally, we propose an extension termed Covariate Gaussian Process Latent
Variable Models for learning nonparametric, nonlinear representations. An R
package implementing variational inference for covariate latent variable models
is available at http://github.com/kieranrcampbell/clvm.

    <title>Variance component score test for time-course gene set analysis of
  longitudinal RNA-seq data</title>
    <summary>  As gene expression measurement technology is shifting from microarrays to
sequencing, the statistical tools available for their analysis must be adapted
since RNA-seq data are measured as counts. Recently, it has been proposed to
tackle the count nature of these data by modeling log-count reads per million
as continuous variables, using nonparametric regression to account for their
inherent heteroscedasticity. Adopting such a framework, we propose tcgsaseq, a
principled, model-free and efficient top-down method for detecting longitudinal
changes in RNA-seq gene sets. Considering gene sets defined a priori, tcgsaseq
identifies those whose expression vary over time, based on an original variance
component score test accounting for both covariates and heteroscedasticity
without assuming any specific parametric distribution for the transformed
counts. We demonstrate that despite the presence of a nonparametric component,
our test statistic has a simple form and limiting distribution, and both may be
computed quickly. A permutation version of the test is additionally proposed
for very small sample sizes. Applied to both simulated data and two real
datasets, the proposed method is shown to exhibit very good statistical
properties, with an increase in stability and power when compared to state of
the art methods ROAST, edgeR and DESeq2, which can fail to control the type I
error under certain realistic settings. We have made the method available for
the community in the R package tcgsaseq.

    <title>HSEARCH: fast and accurate protein sequence motif search and clustering</title>
    <summary>  Protein motifs are conserved fragments occurred frequently in protein
sequences. They have significant functions, such as active site of an enzyme.
Search and clustering protein sequence motifs are computational intensive. Most
existing methods are not fast enough to analyze large data sets for motif
finding or achieve low accuracy for motif clustering. We present a new protein
sequence motif finding and clustering algorithm, called HSEARCH. It converts
fixed length protein sequences to data points in high dimensional space, and
applies locality-sensitive hashing to fast search homologous protein sequences
for a motif. HSEARCH is significantly faster than the brute force algorithm for
protein motif finding and achieves high accuracy for protein motif clustering.

    <title>A Computational Approach to Finding RNA Tertiary Motifs in Genomic
  Sequences</title>
    <summary>  Motif finding in DNA, RNA and proteins plays an important role in life
science research. Recent patents concerning motif finding in the biomolecular
data are recorded in the DNA Patent Database which serves as a resource for
policy makers and members of the general public interested in fields like
genomics, genetics and biotechnology. In this paper we present a computational
approach to mining for RNA tertiary motifs in genomic sequences. Specifically
we describe a method, named CSminer, for finding RNA coaxial helical stackings
in genomes. A coaxial helical stacking occurs in an RNA tertiary structure
where two separate helical elements form a pseudocontiguous helix and provides
thermodynamic stability to the molecule as a whole. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    <title>Discovery of cancer common and specific driver gene sets</title>
    <summary>  Cancer is known as a disease mainly caused by gene alterations. Discovery of
mutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to
understand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically
investigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among
multiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will
undoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized
therapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose
two optimization models to \emph{de novo} discover common driver gene sets
among multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one
certain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We
first apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency.
Then, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As
examples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a
complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver
gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver
pathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML)
versus other solid cancer types. In these processes more candidate cancer genes
are also found.

    <title>Non-equilibrium chromosome looping via molecular slip-links</title>
    <summary>  We propose a model for the formation of chromatin loops based on the
diffusive sliding of a DNA-bound factor which can dimerise to form a molecular
slip-link. Our slip-links mimic the behaviour of cohesin-like molecules, which,
along with the CTCF protein, stabilize loops which organize the genome. By
combining 3D Brownian dynamics simulations and 1D exactly solvable
non-equilibrium models, we show that diffusive sliding is sufficient to account
for the strong bias in favour of convergent CTCF-mediated chromosome loops
observed experimentally. Importantly, our model does not require any
underlying, and energetically costly, motor activity of cohesin. We also find
that the diffusive motion of multiple slip-links along chromatin may be
rectified by an intriguing ratchet effect that arises if slip-links bind to the
chromatin at a preferred "loading site". This emergent collective behaviour is
driven by a 1D osmotic pressure which is set up near the loading point, and
favours the extrusion of loops which are much larger than the ones formed by
single slip-links.

    <title>DeepCancer: Detecting Cancer through Gene Expressions via Deep
  Generative Learning</title>
    <summary>  Transcriptional profiling on microarrays to obtain gene expressions has been
used to facilitate cancer diagnosis. We propose a deep generative machine
learning architecture (called DeepCancer) that learn features from unlabeled
microarray data. These models have been used in conjunction with conventional
classifiers that perform classification of the tissue samples as either being
cancerous or non-cancerous. The proposed model has been tested on two different
clinical datasets. The evaluation demonstrates that DeepCancer model achieves a
very high precision score, while significantly controlling the false positive
and false negative scores.

    <title>Info-Clustering: A Mathematical Theory for Data Clustering</title>
    <summary>  We formulate an info-clustering paradigm based on a multivariate information
measure, called multivariate mutual information, that naturally extends
Shannon's mutual information between two random variables to the multivariate
case involving more than two random variables. With proper model reductions, we
show that the paradigm can be applied to study the human genome and connectome
in a more meaningful way than the conventional algorithmic approach. Not only
can info-clustering provide justifications and refinements to some existing
techniques, but it also inspires new computationally feasible solutions.

    <title>Parenclitic network analysis of methylation data for cancer
  identification</title>
    <summary>  We make use of ideas from the theory of complex networks to implement a
machine learning classification of human DNA methylation data, that carry
signatures of cancer development. The data were obtained from patients with
various kinds of cancers and represented as parenclictic networks, wherein
nodes correspond to genes, and edges are weighted according to pairwise
variation from control group subjects. We demonstrate that for the $10$ types
of cancer under study, it is possible to obtain a high performance of binary
classification between cancer-positive and negative samples based on network
measures. Remarkably, an accuracy as high as $93-99\%$ is achieved with only
$12$ network topology indices, in a dramatic reduction of complexity from the
original $15295$ gene methylation levels. Moreover, it was found that the
parenclictic networks are scale-free in cancer-negative subjects, and deviate
from the power-law node degree distribution in cancer. The node centrality
ranking and arising modular structure could provide insights into the systems
biology of cancer.

    <title>A Noise-Filtering Approach for Cancer Drug Sensitivity Prediction</title>
    <summary>  Accurately predicting drug responses to cancer is an important problem
hindering oncologists' efforts to find the most effective drugs to treat
cancer, which is a core goal in precision medicine. The scientific community
has focused on improving this prediction based on genomic, epigenomic, and
proteomic datasets measured in human cancer cell lines. Real-world cancer cell
lines contain noise, which degrades the performance of machine learning
algorithms. This problem is rarely addressed in the existing approaches. In
this paper, we present a noise-filtering approach that integrates techniques
from numerical linear algebra and information retrieval targeted at filtering
out noisy cancer cell lines. By filtering out noisy cancer cell lines, we can
train machine learning algorithms on better quality cancer cell lines. We
evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it with an existing
approach using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) on clinical trial data. The
experimental results show that our proposed approach is stable and also yields
the highest AUC at a statistically significant level.

    <title>Large scale modeling of antimicrobial resistance with interpretable
  classifiers</title>
    <summary>  Antimicrobial resistance is an important public health concern that has
implications in the practice of medicine worldwide. Accurately predicting
resistance phenotypes from genome sequences shows great promise in promoting
better use of antimicrobial agents, by determining which antibiotics are likely
to be effective in specific clinical cases. In healthcare, this would allow for
the design of treatment plans tailored for specific individuals, likely
resulting in better clinical outcomes for patients with bacterial infections.
In this work, we present the recent work of Drouin et al. (2016) on using Set
Covering Machines to learn highly interpretable models of antibiotic resistance
and complement it by providing a large scale application of their method to the
entire PATRIC database. We report prediction results for 36 new datasets and
present the Kover AMR platform, a new web-based tool allowing the visualization
and interpretation of the generated models.

    <title>Multi-stage Clustering of Breast Cancer for Precision Medicine</title>
    <summary>  Cancer has become one of the most widespread diseases in the world.
Specifically, breast cancer is diagnosed more often than any other type of
cancer. However, breast cancer patients and their individual tumors are often
unique. Identifying the underlying genetic phenotype can lead to precision
(personalized) medicine. Tailoring medical treatment strategies to best fit the
needs of individual patients can dramatically improve their health. Such an
approach requires sufficient knowledge of the patients and the diseases, which
is currently unavailable to practitioners. This study focuses on breast cancer
and proposes a novel two-stage clustering method to partition patients into
hierarchical groups. The first stage is broad grouping, which is based on
phenotypes such as demographic information and clinical features. The second
stage is fine grouping based on genomic characteristics, such as copy number
variation and somatic mutation, of patients in a subgroup resulting from the
first stage. Generally, this framework offers a mechanism to mix multiple forms
of data, both phenotypic and genomic, to most effectively define individual
patients for personalized predictions. This method provides the ability to
detect correlation among all factors.

    <title>Dynamical System Modeling to Simulate Donor T Cell Response to Whole
  Exome Sequencing-Derived Recipient Peptides: Understanding Randomness in
  Clinical Outcomes Following Stem Cell Transplantation</title>
    <summary>  Alloreactivity following stem cell transplantation (SCT) is difficult to
predict in patients undergoing transplantation from HLA matched donors. In this
study we performed whole exome sequencing of SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP).
This allowed determination of entire library of alloreactive peptide sequences
which would bind HLA class I molecules in each DRP. Utilizing the HLA binding
affinity (IC50) and tissue expression levels of the parent proteins, an
aggregate donor T cell response to the recipient alloreactive peptides was
calculated using a vector-operator dynamical system model. Marked variability
in the simulated CD8+ T cell responses was observed in all the donor recipient
pairs.

    <title>Specificity-determining DNA triplet code for positioning of human
  pre-initiation complex</title>
    <summary>  The notion that transcription factors bind DNA only through specific,
consensus binding sites has been recently questioned. In a pioneering study by
Pugh and Venters no specific consensus motif for the positioning of the human
pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been identified. Here, we reveal that
nonconsensus, statistical, DNA triplet code provides specificity for the
positioning of the human PIC. In particular, we reveal a highly non-random,
statistical pattern of repetitive nucleotide triplets that correlates with the
genome-wide binding preferences of PIC measured by Chip-exo. We analyze the
triplet enrichment and depletion near the transcription start site (TSS) and
identify triplets that have the strongest effect on PIC-DNA nonconsensus
binding. Our results constitute a proof-of-concept for a new design principle
for protein-DNA recognition in the human genome, which can lead to a better
mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation.

    <title>Critical dynamics of gene networks is a mechanism behind ageing and
  Gompertz law</title>
    <summary>  Although accumulation of molecular damage is suggested to be an important
molecular mechanism of aging, a quantitative link between the dynamics of
damage accumulation and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. To
address this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene
regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and
the associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the
critical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the
analysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in
Drosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly
critical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in
the form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and
causes the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a
form of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality
deceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that
aging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory
errors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of
signaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We
also establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting
genetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is characterized best, is
strongly associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, our findings
support the idea that aging is the driving force behind the development of
chronic human diseases.

    <title>GateKeeper: A New Hardware Architecture for Accelerating Pre-Alignment
  in DNA Short Read Mapping</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: High throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies generate an
excessive number of small DNA segments -called short reads- that cause
significant computational burden. To analyze the entire genome, each of the
billions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on the
similarity between a read and "candidate" locations in that reference genome.
The similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate
string matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is
implemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the
majority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a
given read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such
incorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern
read mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and
effective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate
them before using computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We
propose GateKeeper, a new hardware accelerator that functions as a
pre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate locations.
GateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much
faster than software. GateKeeper can be integrated with any mapper that
performs sequence alignment for verification. When implemented on a single FPGA
chip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average &gt;96%) while providing up
to 105-fold and 215-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software
pre-alignment techniques, Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD),
respectively. Availability: GateKeeper is available at:

    <title>Fast low-level pattern matching algorithm</title>
    <summary>  This paper focuses on pattern matching in the DNA sequence. It was inspired
by a previously reported method that proposes encoding both pattern and
sequence using prime numbers. Although fast, the method is limited to rather
small pattern lengths, due to computing precision problem. Our approach
successfully deals with large patterns, due to our implementation that uses
modular arithmetic. In order to get the results very fast, the code was adapted
for multithreading and parallel implementations. The method is reduced to
assembly language level instructions, thus the final result shows significant
time and memory savings compared to the reference algorithm.

    <title>Duplication Distance to the Root for Binary Sequences</title>
    <summary>  We study the tandem duplication distance between binary sequences and their
roots. In other words, the quantity of interest is the number of tandem
duplication operations of the form $\seq x = \seq a \seq b \seq c \to \seq y =
\seq a \seq b \seq b \seq c$, where $\seq x$ and $\seq y$ are sequences and
$\seq a$, $\seq b$, and $\seq c$ are their substrings, needed to generate a
binary sequence of length $n$ starting from a square-free sequence from the set
$\{0,1,01,10,010,101\}$. This problem is a restricted case of finding the
duplication/deduplication distance between two sequences, defined as the
minimum number of duplication and deduplication operations required to
transform one sequence to the other. We consider both exact and approximate
tandem duplications. For exact duplication, denoting the maximum distance to
the root of a sequence of length $n$ by $f(n)$, we prove that $f(n)=\Theta(n)$.
For the case of approximate duplication, where a $\beta$-fraction of symbols
may be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the maximum distance has a sharp
transition from linear in $n$ to logarithmic at $\beta=1/2$. We also study the
duplication distance to the root for sequences with a given root and for
special classes of sequences, namely, the de Bruijn sequences, the Thue-Morse
sequence, and the Fibbonaci words. The problem is motivated by genomic tandem
duplication mutations and the smallest number of tandem duplication events
required to generate a given biological sequence.

    <title>Supra-operonic clusters of functionally related genes (SOCs) are a
  source of horizontal gene co-transfers</title>
    <summary>  Adaptation of bacteria occurs predominantly via horizontal gene transfer
(HGT). While it is widely recognized that horizontal acquisitions frequently
encompass multiple genes, it is unclear what the size distribution of
successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces
shape this distribution. Here, we identified 1790 gene family pairs that were
consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli
strains. We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they
were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper
bound at 30 kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70 kb) in
other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions
via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as
they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The
observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much
broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within
operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size
distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and
co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs
form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.

    <title>Genomic Region Detection via Spatial Convex Clustering</title>
    <summary>  Several modern genomic technologies, such as DNA-Methylation arrays, measure
spatially registered probes that number in the hundreds of thousands across
multiplechromosomes. The measured probes are by themselves less interesting
scientifically; instead scientists seek to discover biologically interpretable
genomic regions comprised of contiguous groups of probes which may act as
biomarkers of disease or serve as a dimension-reducing pre-processing step for
downstream analyses. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised feature
learning technique which maps technological units (probes) to biological units
(genomic regions) that are common across all subjects. We use ideas from fusion
penalties and convex clustering to introduce a method for Spatial Convex
Clustering, or SpaCC. Our method is specifically tailored to detecting
multi-subject regions of methylation, but we also test our approach on the
well-studied problem of detecting segments of copy number variation. We
formulate our method as a convex optimization problem, develop a massively
parallelizable algorithm to find its solution, and introduce automated
approaches for handling missing values and determining tuning parameters.
Through simulation studies based on real methylation and copy number variation
data, we show that SpaCC exhibits significant performance gains relative to
existing methods. Finally, we illustrate SpaCC's advantages as a pre-processing
technique that reduces large-scale genomics data into a smaller number of
genomic regions through several cancer epigenetics case studies on subtype
discovery, network estimation, and epigenetic-wide association.

    <title>Full Reconstruction of Non-Stationary Strand-Symmetric Models on Rooted
  Phylogenies</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the evolutionary relationship among species is of fundamental
importance to the biological sciences. The location of the root in any
phylogenetic tree is critical as it gives an order to evolutionary events. None
of the popular models of nucleotide evolution used in likelihood or Bayesian
methods are able to infer the location of the root without exogenous
information. It is known that the most general Markov models of nucleotide
substitution can also not identify the location of the root or be fitted to
multiple sequence alignments with less than three sequences. We prove that the
location of the root and the full model can be identified and statistically
consistently estimated for a non-stationary, strand-symmetric substitution
model given a multiple sequence alignment with two or more sequences. We also
generalise earlier work to provide a practical means of overcoming the
computationally intractable problem of labelling hidden states in a
phylogenetic model.

    <title>Mouse T cell repertoires as statistical ensembles: overall
  characterization and age dependence</title>
    <summary>  The ability of the adaptive immune system to respond to arbitrary pathogens
stems from the broad diversity of immune cell surface receptors (TCRs). This
diversity originates in a stochastic DNA editing process (VDJ recombination)
that acts each time a new immune cell is created from a stem cell. By analyzing
T cell sequence repertoires taken from the blood and thymus of mice of
different ages, we quantify the significant changes in this process that occur
in development from embryo to young adult. We find a rapid increase with age in
the number of random insertions in the VDJ recombination process, leading to a
dramatic increase in diversity. Since the blood accumulates thymic output over
time, blood repertoires are mixtures of different statistical recombination
processes and, by unraveling the mixture statistics, we can obtain a clear
picture of the time evolution of the early immune system. Sequence repertoire
analysis also allows us to detect the effect of selection on the output of the
VDJ recombination process. The effects we find are nearly identical between
thymus and blood, suggesting that they mainly reflect selection for proper
folding of the TCR receptor protein.

    <title>Effects of initial telomere length distribution on senescence onset and
  heterogeneity</title>
    <summary>  Replicative senescence, induced by telomere shortening, exhibits considerable
asynchrony and heterogeneity, the origins of which remain unclear. Here, we
formally study how telomere shortening mechanisms impact on senescence kinetics
and define two regimes of senescence, depending on the initial telomere length
variance. We provide analytical solutions to the model, highlighting a
non-linear relationship between senescence onset and initial telomere length
distribution. This study reveals the complexity of the collective behavior of
telomeres as they shorten, leading to senescence heterogeneity.

    <title>Reverse vaccinology in Plasmodium falciparum 3D7</title>
    <summary>  A timely immunization can be effective against certain diseases and can save
thousands of lives. However, for some diseases it has been difficult, so far,
to develop an efficient vaccine. Malaria, a tropical disease caused by a
parasite of the genus Plasmodium, is one example. Bioinformatics has opened the
way to new lines of experimental investigation One example is reverse
vaccinology that aims to identify antigens that are capable of generating an
immune response in a given organism using in silico studies. In this study we
applied a reverse vaccinology methodology using a bioinformatics pipeline. We
obtained 45 potential linear B cells consensus epitopes from the whole genome
of P. falciparum 3D7 that can be used as candidates for malaria vaccines. The
direct implication of the results obtained is to open the way to experimentally
validate more epitopes to increase the efficiency of the available treatments
against malaria and to explore the methodology in other diseases.

    <title>Computational genomic algorithms for miRNA-based diagnosis of lung
  cancer: the potential of machine learning</title>
    <summary>  The advent of large scale, high-throughput genomic screening has introduced a
wide range of tests for diagnostic purposes. Prominent among them are tests
using miRNA expression levels. Genomics and proteomics now provide expression
levels of hundreds of miRNAs at a time. However, for actual diagnostic tools to
become reality requires the simultaneous development of methods to interpret
the large amounts of miRNA expression data that can be generated from a single
patient sample. Because these data are in numeric form, quantitative methods
must be developed. Statistics such as p-values and log fold change give some
insight, but the diagnostic effectiveness of each miRNA test must first be
evaluated. Here, the author has developed a traditional, sensitivity- and
specificity-based algorithm, as well as a modern machine learning algorithm,
and evaluated their diagnostic potential for lung cancer against a publicly
available database. The findings suggest that the machine learning algorithm
achieves higher accuracy (97% for cancerous and 73% for normal samples), in
addition to providing confidence intervals that could provide valuable
diagnostic support. The machine learning algorithm also has significant
potential for expansion to more complex diagnoses of lung cancer sub-types, to
other cancers as well diseases beyond cancer. Both algorithms are available on
the Github repo: https://github.com/neerja-g/machine-learning-miRNA.

    <title>Detection of regulator genes and eQTLs in gene networks</title>
    <summary>  Genetic differences between individuals associated to quantitative phenotypic
traits, including disease states, are usually found in non-coding genomic
regions. These genetic variants are often also associated to differences in
expression levels of nearby genes (they are "expression quantitative trait
loci" or eQTLs for short) and presumably play a gene regulatory role, affecting
the status of molecular networks of interacting genes, proteins and
metabolites. Computational systems biology approaches to reconstruct causal
gene networks from large-scale omics data have therefore become essential to
understand the structure of networks controlled by eQTLs together with other
regulatory genes, and to generate detailed hypotheses about the molecular
mechanisms that lead from genotype to phenotype. Here we review the main
analytical methods and softwares to identify eQTLs and their associated genes,
to reconstruct co-expression networks and modules, to reconstruct causal
Bayesian gene and module networks, and to validate predicted networks in
silico.

    <title>Functional architecture and global properties of the Corynebacterium
  glutamicum regulatory network: novel insights from a dataset with a high
  genomic coverage</title>
    <summary>  Corynebacterium glutamicum is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped soil
bacterium able to grow on a diversity of carbon sources like sugars and organic
acids. It is a biotechnological relevant organism because of its highly
efficient ability to biosynthesize amino acids, such as L-glutamic acid and
L-lysine. Here, we reconstructed the most complete C. glutamicum regulatory
network to date and comprehensively analyzed its global organizational
properties, systems-level features and functional architecture. Our analyses
show the tremendous power of Abasy Atlas to study the functional organization
of regulatory networks. We created two models of the C. glutamicum regulatory
network: all-evidences (containing both weak and strong supported interactions,
genomic coverage = 73%) and strongly-supported (only accounting for strongly
supported evidences, genomic coverage = 71%). Using state-of-the-art
methodologies, we prove that power-law behaviors truly govern the connectivity
and clustering coefficient distributions. We found a non-previously reported
circuit motif that we named complex feed-forward motif. We highlighted the
importance of feedback loops for the functional architecture, beyond whether
they are statistically over-represented or not in the network. We show that the
previously reported top-down approach is inadequate to infer the hierarchy
governing a regulatory network because feedback bridges different hierarchical
layers, and the top-down approach disregards the presence of intermodular genes
shaping the integration layer. Our findings all together further support a
diamond-shaped, three-layered hierarchy exhibiting some feedback between
processing and coordination layers, which is shaped by four classes of
systems-level elements: global regulators, locally autonomous modules, basal
machinery and intermodular genes.

    <title>A single step protein assay that is both detergent and reducer
  compatible: The cydex blue assay</title>
    <summary>  Determination of protein concentration in often an absolute pre-requisite in
preparing samples for biochemical and proteomic analyses. However, current
protein assay methods are not compatible with both reducers and detergents,
which are however present simultaneously in most denaturing extraction buffers
used in proteomics and electrophoresis, and in particular in SDS
electrophoresis. We found that inclusion of cyclodextrins in a Coomassie
blue-based assay made it compatible with detergents, as cyclodextrins complex
detergents in a 1:1 molecular ratio. As this type of assay is intrinsically
resistant to reducers, we have thus developed a single step assay that is both
detergent and reducer compatible. Depending on the type and concentration of
detergents present in the sample buffer, either beta-cyclodextrin or
alpha-cyclodextrin can be used, the former being able to complex a wider range
of detergents and the latter being able to complex higher amounts of detergents
due to its greater solubility in water. Cyclodextrins are used at final
concentrations of 2-10 mg/mL in the assay mix. This typically allows to measure
samples containing as little as 0.1 mg/mL protein, in the presence of up to 2%
detergent and reducers such as 5 % mercaptoethanol or 50 mM DTT in a single
step with a simple spectrophotometric assay. This article is protected by

    <title>Pan-genome Analysis of the Genus Serratia</title>
    <summary>  Pan-genome analysis is a standard procedure to decipher genome heterogeneity
and diversification of bacterial species. Specie evolution is traced by
defining and comparing the core (conserved), accessory (dispensable) and unique
(strain-specific) gene pool with other strains of interest. Here, we present
pan-genome analysis of the genus Serratia, comprising of a dataset of 100
genomes. The isolates have clinical to environmental origin and consist of ten
different species from the genus, along with two subspecies of the
representative strain Serratia marcescens. Out of 19430 non-redundant coding
DNA sequences (CDS) from the dataset, 972 (5%) belonged to the core genome.
Majority of these genes were linked to metabolic function, followed by cellular
processes/signalling, information storage/processing while rest of them were
poorly characterized. 10,135 CDSs (52.16%) were associated with dispensible
genome while 8,321 CDSs (42.82%) were singletons or strain specific. The
Pan-genome orthologs indicated a positive correlation to the number of genomes
whereas negative correlation was obtained for core genome. Genomes were aligned
to obtain information about synteny, insertion/inversion, deletion and
duplications. This study provides insights into variation of Serratia species
and paves way for pan-genome analysis of other bacterial species at genus
level.

    <title>A Unified Model for Differential Expression Analysis of RNA-seq Data via
  L1-Penalized Linear Regression</title>
    <summary>  The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular for quantifying
gene expression levels. Since the RNA-seq measurements are relative in nature,
between-sample normalization of counts is an essential step in differential
expression (DE) analysis. The normalization of existing DE detection algorithms
is ad hoc and performed once for all prior to DE detection, which may be
suboptimal since ideally normalization should be based on non-DE genes only and
thus coupled with DE detection. We propose a unified statistical model for
joint normalization and DE detection of log-transformed RNA-seq data.
Sample-specific normalization factors are modeled as unknown parameters in the
gene-wise linear models and jointly estimated with the regression coefficients.
By imposing sparsity-inducing L1 penalty (or mixed L1/L2-norm for multiple
treatment conditions) on the regression coefficients, we formulate the problem
as a penalized least-squares regression problem and apply the augmented
lagrangian method to solve it. Simulation studies show that the proposed model
and algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of detection power and
false-positive rate when more than half of the genes are differentially
expressed and/or when the up- and down-regulated genes among DE genes are
unbalanced in amount.

sequence with a very high mean coverage in order to make sure that all parts of
the sample DNA get covered by the reads produced. This leads to huge datasets
with lots of redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is
advisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm Diginorm for this
purpose, which filters reads based on the abundance of their $k$-mers. We
present Bignorm, a faster and quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An
important new feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a
detailed analysis of the $k$-mer counts to decide which reads to keep. With
recommended parameters, in terms of median we remove 97.15% of the reads while
keeping the mean phred score of the filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes
assembler, we produce assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets
in a fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets filtered
with Diginorm. We conclude that read filtering is a practical method for
reducing read data and for speeding up the assembly process. Our Bignorm
algorithm allows assemblies of competitive quality in comparison to Diginorm,
while being much faster. Bignorm is available for download at

    <title>Stochastic predator-prey dynamics of transposons in the human genome</title>
    <summary>  Transposable elements, or transposons, are DNA sequences that can jump from
site to site in the genome during the life cycle of a cell, usually encoding
the very enzymes which perform their excision. However, some transposons are
parasitic, relying on the enzymes produced by the regular transposons. In this
case, we show that a stochastic model, which takes into account the small copy
numbers of the transposons in a cell, predicts noise-induced predator-prey
oscillations with a characteristic time scale that is much longer than the cell
replication time, indicating that the state of the predator-prey oscillator is
stored in the genome and transmitted to successive generations. Our work
demonstrates the important role of number fluctuations in the expression of
mobile genetic elements, and shows explicitly how ecological concepts can be
applied to the dynamics and fluctuations of living genomes.

    <title>Effective Classification of MicroRNA Precursors Using Combinatorial
  Feature Mining and AdaBoost Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with approximately 22 nucleotides (nt)
that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursor molecules or
pre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large
number of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is
a challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences
with similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several
computational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this
paper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying
microRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary
structures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous
studies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the
literature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify
suitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector
machines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is
constructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the
accuracy of the classifier ensemble. Experimental results on a variety of
species demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method, and its
superiority over existing tools.

    <title>Prediction of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Promoters Using Convolutional
  Deep Learning Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Accurate computational identification of promoters remains a challenge as
these key DNA regulatory regions have variable structures composed of
functional motifs that provide gene specific initiation of transcription. In
this paper we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze sequence
characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters and build their
predictive models. We trained the same CNN architecture on promoters of four
very distant organisms: human, plant (Arabidopsis), and two bacteria
(Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma pneumonia). We found that CNN trained on
sigma70 subclass of Escherichia coli promoter gives an excellent classification
of promoters and non-promoter sequences (Sn=0.90, Sp=0.96, CC=0.84). The
Bacillus subtilis promoters identification CNN model achieves Sn=0.91, Sp=0.95,
and CC=0.86. For human and Arabidopsis promoters we employ CNNs for
identification of two well-known promoter classes (TATA and non-TATA
promoters). CNNs models nicely recognize these complex functional regions. For
human Sn/Sp/CC accuracy of prediction reached 0.95/0.98/0,90 on TATA and
0.90/0.98/0.89 for non-TATA promoter sequences, respectively. For Arabidopsis
we observed Sn/Sp/CC 0.95/0.97/0.91 (TATA) and 0.94/0.94/0.86 (non-TATA)
promoters. Thus, the developed CNN models (implemented in CNNProm program)
demonstrated the ability of deep learning with grasping complex promoter
sequence characteristics and achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to
the previously developed promoter prediction programs. As the suggested
approach does not require knowledge of any specific promoter features, it can
be easily extended to identify promoters and other complex functional regions
in sequences of many other and especially newly sequenced genomes. The CNNProm
program is available to run at web server http://www.softberry.com.

    <title>Parallel Pairwise Correlation Computation On Intel Xeon Phi Clusters</title>
    <summary>  Co-expression network is a critical technique for the identification of
inter-gene interactions, which usually relies on all-pairs correlation (or
similar measure) computation between gene expression profiles across multiple
samples. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) is one widely used technique
for gene co-expression network construction. However, all-pairs PCC computation
is computationally demanding for large numbers of gene expression profiles,
thus motivating our acceleration of its execution using high-performance
computing. In this paper, we present LightPCC, the first parallel and
distributed all-pairs PCC computation on Intel Xeon Phi (Phi) clusters. It
achieves high speed by exploring the SIMD-instruction-level and thread-level
parallelism within Phis as well as accelerator-level parallelism among multiple
Phis. To facilitate balanced workload distribution, we have proposed a general
framework for symmetric all-pairs computation by building bijective functions
between job identifier and coordinate space for the first time. We have
evaluated LightPCC and compared it to two CPU-based counterparts: a sequential
C++ implementation in ALGLIB and an implementation based on a parallel general
matrix-matrix multiplication routine in Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) (all
use double precision), using a set of gene expression datasets. Performance
evaluation revealed that with one 5110P Phi and 16 Phis, LightPCC runs up to
$20.6\times$ and $218.2\times$ faster than ALGLIB, and up to $6.8\times$ and
$71.4\times$ faster than single-threaded MKL, respectively. In addition,
LightPCC demonstrated good parallel scalability in terms of number of Phis.
Source code of LightPCC is publicly available at

    <title>The SCJ small parsimony problem for weighted gene adjacencies (Extended
  version)</title>
    <summary>  Reconstructing ancestral gene orders in a given phylogeny is a classical
problem in comparative genomics. Most existing methods compare conserved
features in extant genomes in the phylogeny to define potential ancestral gene
adjacencies, and either try to reconstruct all ancestral genomes under a global
evolutionary parsimony criterion, or, focusing on a single ancestral genome,
use a scaffolding approach to select a subset of ancestral gene adjacencies,
generally aiming at reducing the fragmentation of the reconstructed ancestral
genome. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for the Small Parsimony
Problem that combines both approaches. We consider that gene adjacencies at
internal nodes of the species phylogeny are weighted, and we introduce an
objective function defined as a convex combination of these weights and the
evolutionary cost under the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. The weights of
ancestral gene adjacencies can e.g. be obtained through the recent availability
of ancient DNA sequencing data, which provide a direct hint at the genome
structure of the considered ancestor, or through probabilistic analysis of gene
adjacencies evolution. We show the NP-hardness of our problem variant and
propose a Fixed-Parameter Tractable algorithm based on the Sankoff-Rousseau
dynamic programming algorithm that also allows to sample co-optimal solutions.
We apply our approach to mammalian and bacterial data providing different
degrees of complexity. We show that including adjacency weights in the
objective has a significant impact in reducing the fragmentation of the
reconstructed ancestral gene orders.

    <title>Multiple Comparative Metagenomics using Multiset k-mer Counting</title>
    <summary>  Background. Large scale metagenomic projects aim to extract biodiversity
knowledge between different environmental conditions. Current methods for
comparing microbial communities face important limitations. Those based on
taxonomical or functional assignation rely on a small subset of the sequences
that can be associated to known organisms. On the other hand, de novo methods,
that compare the whole sets of sequences, either do not scale up on ambitious
metagenomic projects or do not provide precise and exhaustive results.
  Methods. These limitations motivated the development of a new de novo
metagenomic comparative method, called Simka. This method computes a large
collection of standard ecological distances by replacing species counts by
k-mer counts. Simka scales-up today's metagenomic projects thanks to a new
parallel k-mer counting strategy on multiple datasets.
  Results. Experiments on public Human Microbiome Project datasets demonstrate
that Simka captures the essential underlying biological structure. Simka was
able to compute in a few hours both qualitative and quantitative ecological
distances on hundreds of metagenomic samples (690 samples, 32 billions of
reads). We also demonstrate that analyzing metagenomes at the k-mer level is
highly correlated with extremely precise de novo comparison techniques which
rely on all-versus-all sequences alignment strategy or which are based on
taxonomic profiling.

    <title>Network-regularized Sparse Logistic Regression Models for Clinical Risk
  Prediction and Biomarker Discovery</title>
    <summary>  Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical
risk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate
other prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to
improve the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers.
Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
framework with regularized term $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 +
\eta\bm{w}^T\bm{M}\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including
Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\bm{M}$. This
framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the
computing speed. However, if those estimated $\bm{w}_i$ and $\bm{w}_j$ have
opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not
perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR
model with a new penalty $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 + \eta|\bm{w}|^T\bm{M}|\bm{w}|$
to consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And
we develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods
and compare them with the related ones using simulated and real data to show
their efficiency.

    <title>Relation between Gene Content and Taxonomy in Chloroplasts</title>
    <summary>  The aim of this study is to investigate the relation that can be found
between the phylogeny of a large set of complete chloroplast genomes, and the
evolution of gene content inside these sequences. Core and pan genomes have
been computed on \textit{de novo} annotation of these 845 genomes, the former
being used for producing well-supported phylogenetic tree while the latter
provides information regarding the evolution of gene contents over time. It
details too the specificity of some branches of the tree, when specificity is
obtained on accessory genes. After having detailed the material and methods, we
emphasize some remarkable relation between well-known events of the chloroplast
history, like endosymbiosis, and the evolution of gene contents over the
phylogenetic tree.

    <title>Searching for Gene Sets with Mutually Exclusive Mutations</title>
    <summary>  Cancer cells evolve through random somatic mutations. "Beneficial" mutations
which disrupt key pathways (e.g. cell cycle regulation) are subject to natural
selection. Multiple mutations may lead to the same "beneficial" effect, in
which case there is no selective advantage to having more than one of these
mutations. Hence we are interested in finding sets of genes whose mutations are
approximately mutually exclusive (anti-co-occurring) within the TCGA Pancancer
dataset. In principle, finding the best set is NP Hard. Nevertheless, we will
show how a new Mutation anti-co-OCcurrence Algorithm (MOCA) provides an
effective greedy search and testing algorithm with guaranteed control of the
familywise error rate or false discovery rate, by combining some
under-appreciated ideas from frequentist hypothesis testing. These ideas
include: (a) A novel exact conditional test for the tendency of multiple sets
to have a large/small union/intersection, which generalises Fisher's exact test
of 2x2 tables. (b) Randomised hypothesis tests for discrete distributions. (c)
Stouffer's method for combining p-values. (d) Weighted multiple hypothesis
testing. A new approach to setting a-priori weights which generates additional
implicit hypothesis tests is suggested, and allows us to preserve almost all
statistical power when testing pairs despite introducing a combinatorially
large number of additional hypotheses.

    <title>A Quadratically Regularized Functional Canonical Correlation Analysis
  for Identifying the Global Structure of Pleiotropy with NGS Data</title>
    <summary>  Investigating the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants can increase
statistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding
of the complex genetic structures of disease, and offer powerful tools for
designing effective treatments with fewer side effects. However, the current
multiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of
phenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth
(hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high
dimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal
representation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data.
To explore multiple levels of representations of genetic variants, learn their
internal patterns involved in the disease development, and overcome critical
barriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and
computational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new
framework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA)
for association analysis which combines three approaches: (1) quadratically
regularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3)
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the
QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the nine competing statistics while
retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the
QRFCCA and nine other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing
dataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare
variants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46
traits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms
the nine other statistics.

    <title>BAUM: A DNA Assembler by Adaptive Unique Mapping and Local
  Overlap-Layout-Consensus</title>
    <summary>  Genome assembly from the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads is a
fundamental yet challenging computational problem. An intrinsic challenge is
the uncertainty caused by the widespread repetitive elements. Here we get
around the uncertainty using the notion of uniquely mapped (UM) reads, which
motivated the design of a new assembler BAUM. It mainly consists of two types
of iterations. The first type of iterations constructs initial contigs from a
reference, say a genome of a species that could be quite distant, by adaptive
read mapping, filtration by the reference's unique regions, and reference
updating. A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible
structural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,
scaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging. We extend each contig by
locally assembling the reads whose mates are uniquely mapped to an end of the
contig. Instead of the de Bruijn graph method, we take the
overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm. The OLC is implemented by parallel
computation, and has linear complexity with respect to the number of contigs.
The adjacent extended contigs are merged if their alignment is confirmed by the
adjusted gap distance. Throughout the assembling, the mapping criterion is
selected by probabilistic calculations. These innovations can be used
complementary to the existing de novo assemblers. Applying this novel method to
the assembly of wild rice Oryza longistaminata genome, we achieved much
improved contig N50, 18.8k, compared with other assemblers. The assembly was
further validated by contigs constructed from an independent library of long
454 reads.

    <title>Assessment of P-value variability in the current replicability crisis</title>
    <summary>  Increased availability of data and accessibility of computational tools in
recent years have created unprecedented opportunities for scientific research
driven by statistical analysis. Inherent limitations of statistics impose
constrains on reliability of conclusions drawn from data but misuse of
statistical methods is a growing concern. Significance, hypothesis testing and
the accompanying P-values are being scrutinized as representing most widely
applied and abused practices. One line of critique is that P-values are
inherently unfit to fulfill their ostensible role as measures of scientific
hypothesis's credibility. It has also been suggested that while P-values may
have their role as summary measures of effect, researchers underappreciate the
degree of randomness in the P-value. High variability of P-values would suggest
that having obtained a small P-value in one study, one is, nevertheless, likely
to obtain a much larger P-value in a similarly powered replication study. Thus,
"replicability of P-value" is itself questionable. To characterize P-value
variability one can use prediction intervals whose endpoints reflect the likely
spread of P-values that could have been obtained by a replication study.
Unfortunately, the intervals currently in use, the P-intervals, are based on
unrealistic implicit assumptions. Namely, P-intervals are constructed with the
assumptions that imply substantial chances of encountering large values of
effect size in an observational study, which leads to bias. As an alternative
to P-intervals, we develop a method that gives researchers flexibility by
providing them with the means to control these assumptions. Unlike endpoints of
P-intervals, endpoints of our intervals are directly interpreted as
probabilistic bounds for replication P-values and are resistant to selection
bias contingent upon approximate prior knowledge of the effect size
distribution.

    <title>Learning Directed-Acyclic-Graphs from Large-Scale Genomics Data</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we consider the problem of learning the
genetic-interaction-map, i.e., the topology of a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
of genetic interactions from noisy double knockout (DK) data. Based on a set of
well established biological interaction models we detect and classify the
interactions between genes. We propose a novel linear integer optimization
program called the Genetic-Interactions-Detector (GENIE) to identify the
complex biological dependencies among genes and to compute the DAG topology
that matches the DK measurements best. Furthermore, we extend the GENIE-program
by incorporating genetic-interactions-profile (GI-profile) data to further
enhance the detection performance. In addition, we propose a sequential
scalability technique for large sets of genes under study, in order to provide
statistically stressable results for real measurement data. Finally, we show
via numeric simulations that the GENIE-program as well as the GI-profile data
extended GENIE (GI-GENIE)-program clearly outperform the conventional
techniques and present real data results for our proposed sequential
scalability technique.

    <title>Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: algorithms
  for controlling the false discovery rate</title>
    <summary>  Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling
the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we consider an
extension of Efron's single-study two-groups model to allow joint analysis of
multiple studies. We assume that given a set of p-values obtained from each
study, the researcher is interested in associations that recur in at least
$k&gt;1$ studies. We propose new algorithms that differ in how the study
dependencies are modeled. We compared our new methods and others using various
simulated scenarios. The top performing algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable
Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that is based on
three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies,
(2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging
the results across the clusters using dynamic programming. We applied SCREEN to
two real datasets and demonstrated that it greatly outperforms the results
obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control
large-scale gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large up-regulated
module of genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes
are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well
connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that
examined the expression profiles of patients with or without mutations in the
HLA complex, we detected an active module of up-regulated genes that are
related to immune responses. Thanks to our ability to quantify the false
discovery rate, we detected thrice more genes as compared to the original
study. Our module contains most of the genes reported in the original study,
and many new ones. Interestingly, the newly discovered genes are needed to
establish the connectivity of the module.

    <title>The more you test, the more you find: Smallest P-values become
  increasingly enriched with real findings as more tests are conducted</title>
    <summary>  Increasing accessibility of data to researchers makes it possible to conduct
massive amounts of statistical testing. Rather than follow a carefully crafted
set of scientific hypotheses with statistical analysis, researchers can now
test many possible relations and let P-values or other statistical summaries
generate hypotheses for them. Genetic epidemiology field is an illustrative
case in this paradigm shift. Driven by technological advances, testing a
handful of genetic variants in relation to a health outcome has been abandoned
in favor of agnostic screening of the entire genome, followed by selection of
top hits, e.g., by selection of genetic variants with the smallest association
P-values. At the same time, nearly total lack of replication of claimed
associations that has been shaming the field turned to a flow of reports whose
findings have been robustly replicating. Researchers may have adopted better
statistical practices by learning from past failures, but we suggest that a
steep increase in the amount of statistical testing itself is an important
factor. Regardless of whether statistical significance has been reached, an
increased number of tested hypotheses leads to enrichment of smallest P-values
with genuine associations. In this study, we quantify how the expected
proportion of genuine signals (EPGS) among top hits changes with an increasing
number of tests. When the rate of occurrence of genuine signals does not
decrease too sharply to zero as more tests are performed, the smallest P-values
are increasingly more likely to represent genuine associations in studies with
more tests.

    <title>Selecting between-sample RNA-Seq normalization methods from the
  perspective of their assumptions</title>
    <summary>  RNA-Seq is a widely-used method for studying the behavior of genes under
different biological conditions. An essential step in an RNA-Seq study is
normalization, in which raw data are adjusted to account for factors that
prevent direct comparison of expression measures. Errors in normalization can
have a significant impact on downstream analysis, such as inflated false
positives in differential expression analysis. An under-emphasized feature of
normalization is the assumptions upon which the methods rely and how the
validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance
of the methods. In this paper, we explain how assumptions provide the link
between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We
examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an
understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods
appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization
methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes
problems in subsequent analysis. To analyze a biological experiment,
researchers must select a normalization method with assumptions that are met
and that produces a meaningful measure of expression for the given experiment.

    <title>DBG2OLC: Efficient Assembly of Large Genomes Using Long Erroneous Reads
  of the Third Generation Sequencing Technologies</title>
    <summary>  (An updated version of this manuscript has been accepted to Scientific
Reports in 2016, please refer to http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31900)
  The highly anticipated transition from next generation sequencing (NGS) to
third generation sequencing (3GS) has been difficult primarily due to high
error rates and excessive sequencing cost. The high error rates make the
assembly of long erroneous reads of large genomes challenging because existing
software solutions are often overwhelmed by error correction tasks. Here we
report a hybrid assembly approach that simultaneously utilizes NGS and 3GS data
to address both issues. We gain advantages from three general and basic design
principles: (i) Compact representation of the long reads lead to efficient
alignments. (ii) Base-level errors can be skipped; structural errors need to be
detected and corrected. (iii) Structurally correct 3GS reads are assembled and
polished. In our implementation, preassembled NGS contigs are used to derive
the compact representation of the long reads, which established an algorithmic
conversion from a de Bruijn graph to an overlap graph, the two major assembly
paradigms. Moreover, since NGS and 3GS data can compensate each other, our
hybrid assembly approach reduces both of their sequencing requirements.
Experiments show that our software is able to assemble mammalian-sized genomes
orders of magnitude more efficiently in time than existing methods, while
saving about half of the sequencing cost.

    <title>Binary Particle Swarm Optimization versus Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for
  Inferring Well Supported Phylogenetic Trees</title>
    <summary>  The amount of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes increases rapidly
every day, leading to the possibility to build large-scale phylogenetic trees
of plant species. Considering a subset of close plant species defined according
to their chloroplasts, the phylogenetic tree that can be inferred by their core
genes is not necessarily well supported, due to the possible occurrence of
problematic genes (i.e., homoplasy, incomplete lineage sorting, horizontal gene
transfers, etc.) which may blur the phylogenetic signal. However, a trustworthy
phylogenetic tree can still be obtained provided such a number of blurring
genes is reduced. The problem is thus to determine the largest subset of core
genes that produces the best-supported tree. To discard problematic genes and
due to the overwhelming number of possible combinations, this article focuses
on how to extract the largest subset of sequences in order to obtain the most
supported species tree. Due to computational complexity, a distributed Binary
Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is proposed in sequential and distributed
fashions. Obtained results from both versions of the BPSO are compared with
those computed using an hybrid approach embedding both genetic algorithms and
statistical tests. The proposal has been applied to different cases of plant
families, leading to encouraging results for these families.

    <title>TROM: A Testing-based Method for Finding Transcriptomic Similarity of
  Biological Samples</title>
    <summary>  Comparative transcriptomics has gained increasing popularity in genomic
research thanks to the development of high-throughput technologies including
microarray and next-generation RNA sequencing that have generated numerous
transcriptomic data. An important question is to understand the conservation
and differentiation of biological processes in different species. We propose a
testing-based method TROM (Transcriptome Overlap Measure) for comparing
transcriptomes within or between different species, and provide a different
perspective to interpret transcriptomic similarity in contrast to traditional
correlation analyses. Specifically, the TROM method focuses on identifying
associated genes that capture molecular characteristics of biological samples,
and subsequently comparing the biological samples by testing the overlap of
their associated genes. We use simulation and real data studies to demonstrate
that TROM is more powerful in identifying similar transcriptomes and more
robust to stochastic gene expression noise than Pearson and Spearman
correlations. We apply TROM to compare the developmental stages of six
Drosophila species, C. elegans, S. purpuratus, D. rerio and mouse liver, and
find interesting correspondence patterns that imply conserved gene expression
programs in the development of these species. The TROM method is available as
an R package on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) with manuals and source codes
available at http://www.stat.ucla.edu/ jingyi.li/software-and-data/trom.html.

    <title>Chaos in DNA Evolution</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we explain why the chaotic model (CM) of Bahi and Michel
(2008) accurately simulates gene mutations over time. First, we demonstrate
that the CM model is a truly chaotic one, as defined by Devaney. Then, we show
that mutations occurring in gene mutations have the same chaotic dynamic, thus
making the use of chaotic models relevant for genome evolution.

    <title>deepTarget: End-to-end Learning Framework for microRNA Target Prediction
  using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short sequences of ribonucleic acids that control the
expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding them. Robust prediction
of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulations but
has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of
computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction.
This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target
prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and
sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an
unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature
extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing
alternatives is substantial (over 25% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget
delivers a quantum leap in the long-standing challenge of robust miRNA target
prediction.

    <title>Associative memory by collective regulation of non-coding RNA</title>
    <summary>  The majority of mammalian genomic transcripts do not directly code for
proteins and it is currently believed that most of these are not under
evolutionary constraint. However given the abundance non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and
its strong affinity for inter-RNA binding, these molecules have the potential
to regulate proteins in a highly distributed way, similar to artificial neural
networks. We explore this analogy by devising a simple architecture for a
biochemical network that can function as an associative memory. We show that
the steady state solution for this chemical network has the same structure as
an associative memory neural network model. By allowing the choice of
equilibrium constants between different ncRNA species, the concentration of
unbound ncRNA can be made to follow any pattern and many patterns can be stored
simultaneously. The model is studied numerically and within certain parameter
regimes it functions as predicted. Even if the starting concentration pattern
is quite different, it is shown to converge to the original pattern most of the
time. The network is also robust to mutations in equilibrium constants. This
calls into question the criteria for deciding if a sequence is under
evolutionary constraint.

    <title>Safe and complete contig assembly via omnitigs</title>
    <summary>  Contig assembly is the first stage that most assemblers solve when
reconstructing a genome from a set of reads. Its output consists of contigs --
a set of strings that are promised to appear in any genome that could have
generated the reads. From the introduction of contigs 20 years ago, assemblers
have tried to obtain longer and longer contigs, but the following question was
never solved: given a genome graph $G$ (e.g. a de Bruijn, or a string graph),
what are all the strings that can be safely reported from $G$ as contigs? In
this paper we finally answer this question, and also give a polynomial time
algorithm to find them. Our experiments show that these strings, which we call
omnitigs, are 66% to 82% longer on average than the popular unitigs, and 29% of
dbSNP locations have more neighbors in omnitigs than in unitigs.

    <title>Inferring unknown biological function by integration of GO annotations
  and gene expression data</title>
    <summary>  Characterizing genes with semantic information is an important process
regarding the description of gene products. In spite that complete genomes of
many organisms have been already sequenced, the biological functions of all of
their genes are still unknown. Since experimentally studying the functions of
those genes, one by one, would be unfeasible, new computational methods for
gene functions inference are needed. We present here a novel computational
approach for inferring biological function for a set of genes with previously
unknown function, given a set of genes with well-known information. This
approach is based on the premise that genes with similar behaviour should be
grouped together. This is known as the guilt-by-association principle. Thus, it
is possible to take advantage of clustering techniques to obtain groups of
unknown genes that are co-clustered with genes that have well-known semantic
information (GO annotations). Meaningful knowledge to infer unknown semantic
information can therefore be provided by these well-known genes. We provide a
method to explore the potential function of new genes according to those
currently annotated. The results obtained indicate that the proposed approach
could be a useful and effective tool when used by biologists to guide the
inference of biological functions for recently discovered genes. Our work sets
an important landmark in the field of identifying unknown gene functions
through clustering, using an external source of biological input. A simple web
interface to this proposal can be found at

    <title>Core-genome scaffold comparison reveals the prevalence that inversion
  events are associated with pairs of inverted repeats</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Genome rearrangement plays an important role in evolutionary
biology and has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from
microbes to humans. The mechanisms for genome rearrangement events remain
unclear. Lots of comparisons have been conducted among different species. To
reveal the mechanisms for rearrangement events, comparison of different
individuals/strains within the same species or genus (pan-genomes) is more
helpful since they are much closer to each other. Results: We study the
mechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different
strains within the same species. We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among
different strains of the same specie. We find an interesting phenomenon that
long (larger than 10,000 bp) inversion regions are flanked by a pair of
Inverted Repeats (IRs) (with lengths ranging from 385 bp to 27476 bp) which are
often Insertion Sequences (ISs).This mechanism can also explain why the
breakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. We study the prevalence of the
phenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. The other
observation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition
and inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also
associated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends
of the swapped regions remain unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first
time such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.

    <title>Sam2bam: High-Performance Framework for NGS Data Preprocessing Tools</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces a high-throughput software tool framework called {\it
sam2bam} that enables users to significantly speedup pre-processing for
next-generation sequencing data. The sam2bam is especially efficient on
single-node multi-core large-memory systems. It can reduce the runtime of data
pre-processing in marking duplicate reads on a single node system by 156-186x
compared with de facto standard tools. The sam2bam consists of parallel
software components that can fully utilize the multiple processors, available
memory, high-bandwidth of storage, and hardware compression accelerators if
available.
  The sam2bam provides file format conversion between well-known genome file
formats, from SAM to BAM, as a basic feature. Additional features such as
analyzing, filtering, and converting the input data are provided by {\it
plug-in} tools, e.g., duplicate marking, which can be attached to sam2bam at
runtime.
  We demonstrated that sam2bam could significantly reduce the runtime of NGS
data pre-processing from about two hours to about one minute for a whole-exome
data set on a 16-core single-node system using up to 130 GB of memory. The
sam2bam could reduce the runtime for whole-genome sequencing data from about 20
hours to about nine minutes on the same system using up to 711 GB of memory.

    <title>Detection of Epigenomic Network Community Oncomarkers</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we propose network methodology to infer prognostic cancer
biomarkers based on the epigenetic pattern DNA methylation. Epigenetic
processes such as DNA methylation reflect environmental risk factors, and are
increasingly recognised for their fundamental role in diseases such as cancer.
DNA methylation is a gene-regulatory pattern, and hence provides a means by
which to assess genomic regulatory interactions. Network models are a natural
way to represent and analyse groups of such interactions. The utility of
network models also increases as the quantity of data and number of variables
increase, making them increasingly relevant to large-scale genomic studies. We
propose methodology to infer prognostic genomic networks from a DNA
methylation-based measure of genomic interaction and association. We then show
how to identify prognostic biomarkers from such networks, which we term
`network community oncomarkers'. We illustrate the power of our proposed
methodology in the context of a large publicly available breast cancer dataset.

    <title>metaSPAdes: a new versatile de novo metagenomics assembler</title>
    <summary>  While metagenomics has emerged as a technology of choice for analyzing
bacterial populations, assembly of metagenomic data remains difficult thus
stifling biological discoveries. metaSPAdes is a new assembler that addresses
the challenge of metagenome analysis and capitalizes on computational ideas
that proved to be useful in assemblies of single cells and highly polymorphic
diploid genomes. We benchmark metaSPAdes against other state-of-the-art
metagenome assemblers across diverse da-tasets and demonstrate that it results
in high-quality assemblies.

    <title>Identification of repeats in DNA sequences using nucleotide distribution
  uniformity</title>
    <summary>  Repetitive elements are important in genomic structures, functions and
regulations, yet effective methods in precisely identifying repetitive elements
in DNA sequences are not fully accessible, and the relationship between
repetitive elements and periodicities of genomes is not clearly understood. We
present an $\textit{ab initio}$ method to quantitatively detect repetitive
elements and infer the consensus repeat pattern in repetitive elements. The
method uses the measure of the distribution uniformity of nucleotides at
periodic positions in DNA sequences or genomes. It can identify periodicities,
consensus repeat patterns, copy numbers and perfect levels of repetitive
elements. The results of using the method on different DNA sequences and
genomes demonstrate efficacy and accuracy in identifying repeat patterns and
periodicities. The complexity of the method is linear with respect to the
lengths of the analyzed sequences.

(SNPs) generating alloreactive peptide libraries for each DRP (9-mer
peptide-HLA complexes); Human CMV CROSS (Cross-Reactive Open Source Sequence)
Database was compiled from NCBI; HLA class I binding affinity for each DRPs HLA
was calculated by NetMHCpan 2.8 and hCMV- derived 9-mers algorithmically
compared to the alloreactive peptide-HLA complex libraries. Short consecutive
(6 or greater) amino acid (AA) sequence homology matching hCMV to recipient
peptides was considered for HLA-bound-peptide (IC50&lt;500 nM) cross reactivity.
Of the 70,686 hCMV 9-mers contained within the hCMV CROSS database, 29,658.8
+/- 9038.5 were found to match MRD DRP alloreactive peptides and 52,910.2 +/-
16121.8 matched MUD DRP peptides (Student's T-test, p&lt;0.001). In silico
analysis revealed multiple high affinity, immunogenic CMV-Human peptide matches
(IC50&lt;500 nM) expressed in GVHD-affected tissue-specific manner (proteins
expressed at 10 RPKM or greater). hCMV+GVHD was found in 18 patients, 13
developing hCMV viremia before GVHD onset with a subset analysis of 7 instances
of hCMV viremia prior to acute GVHD onset (n=3), chronic GVHD (n=2) and acute +
chronic GVHD (n=2) indicating cross reactive peptide expression within affected
organs. We propose that based on our analysis and preliminary clinical
correlations that hCMV immune cross-reactivity may cause antigenic mimicry of
human alloreactive peptides triggering GVHD.

    <title>Robust hyperparameter estimation protects against hypervariable genes
  and improves power to detect differential expression</title>
    <summary>  One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify
genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions.
Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have
been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological
replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced
by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This
article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the
hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of
decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes
while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the
double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be
spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main
body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The
procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics
and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are
present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance
to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power
and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for
which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated
with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically
relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in
the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.

    <title>Genomic data analysis in tree spaces</title>
    <summary>  Recently, an elegant approach in phylogenetics was introduced by
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann that allows a systematic comparison of different
evolutionary histories using the metric geometry of tree spaces. In many
problem settings one encounters heavily populated phylogenetic trees, where the
large number of leaves encumbers visualization and analysis in the relevant
evolutionary moduli spaces. To address this issue, we introduce tree
dimensionality reduction, a structured approach to reducing large phylogenetic
trees to a distribution of smaller trees. We prove a stability theorem ensuring
that small perturbations of the large trees are taken to small perturbations of
the resulting distributions.
  We then present a series of four biologically motivated applications to the
analysis of genomic data, spanning cancer and infectious disease. The first
quantifies how chemotherapy can disrupt the evolution of common leukemias. The
second examines a link between geometric information and the histologic grade
in relapsed gliomas, where longer relapse branches were specific to high grade
glioma. The third concerns genetic stability of xenograft models of cancer,
where heterogeneity at the single cell level increased with later mouse
passages. The last studies genetic diversity in seasonal influenza A virus. We
apply tree dimensionality reduction to 24 years of longitudinally collected
H3N2 hemagglutinin sequences, generating distributions of smaller trees
spanning between three and five seasons. A negative correlation is observed
between the influenza vaccine effectiveness during a season and the variance of
the distributions produced using preceding seasons' sequence data. We also show
how tree distributions relate to antigenic clusters and choice of influenza
vaccine. Our formalism exposes links between viral genomic data and clinical
observables such as vaccine selection and efficacy.

    <title>RasBhari: optimizing spaced seeds for database searching, read mapping
  and alignment-free sequence comparison</title>
    <summary>  Many algorithms for sequence analysis rely on word matching or word
statistics. Often, these approaches can be improved if binary patterns
representing match and don't-care positions are used as a filter, such that
only those positions of words are considered that correspond to the match
positions of the patterns. The performance of these approaches, however,
depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity
of a pattern set that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the
variance of the number of matches between two evolutionarily related sequences
with respect to this pattern set. We propose a modified hill-climbing algorithm
to optimize pattern sets for database searching, read mapping and
alignment-free sequence comparison of nucleic-acid sequences; our
implementation of this algorithm is called rasbhari. Depending on the
application at hand, rasbhari can either minimize the overlap complexity of
pattern sets, maximize their sensitivity in database searching or minimize the
variance of the number of pattern-based matches in alignment-free sequence
comparison. We show that, for database searching, rasbhari generates pattern
sets with slightly higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our Spaced
Words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets calculated
with rasbhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the
randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used. Finally, we used
rasbhari to generate patterns for short read classification with CLARK-S. Here
too, the sensitivity of the results could be improved, compared to the default
patterns of the program. We integrated rasbhari into Spaced Words; the source
code of rasbhari is freely available at http://rasbhari.gobics.de/

    <title>On the Ribosomal Density that Maximizes Protein Translation Rate</title>
    <summary>  During mRNA translation, several ribosomes attach to the same mRNA molecule
simultaneously translating it into a protein. This pipelining increases the
protein production rate. A natural and important question is what ribosomal
density maximizes the protein production rate. Using mathematical models of
ribosome flow along both a linear and a circular mRNA molecule we prove that
typically the steady-state production rate is maximized when the ribosomal
density is one half of the maximal possible density. We discuss the
implications of our results to endogenous genes under natural cellular
conditions and also to synthetic biology.

    <title>A draft genome assembly of southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii</title>
    <summary>  Tuna are large pelagic fish whose populations are close to panmixia. In
addition, they are threatened species, so it is important for the maintenance
and monitoring of genetic diversity that genetic information at a genome level
be obtained. Here we report the draft assembly of the southern bluefin tuna
genome and the collection of genome-wide sequence data for five other tuna
species. We sampled five tuna species of the genus Thunnus, the northern and
southern bluefin, yellowfin, albacore, and bigeye, as well as the skipjack
(Katsuwonis pelamis), a tuna-like species. Genome assembly was facilitated at
k-mer=25 while k-mer=51 generated assembly artefacts. The estimated size of the
southern bluefin tuna genome was 795 Mb. We assembled two southern bluefin tuna
individuals independently using both paired end and mate pair sequence. This
resulted in scaffolds with N50&gt;174,000 bp and maximum scaffold lengths&gt;1.4 Mb.
Our estimate of the size of the assembled genome was the scaffolded sequences
in common to both assemblies, which amounted to 721 Mb of the 795 Mb of the
southern bluefin tuna genome sequence. Using BLAST, there were matches between
13,039 of 14,341 (91%) refseq mRNA of the zebrafish Danio rerio to the tuna
assembly indicating that most of a generic fish transcriptome was covered by
the assembly.

    <title>Using Genetic Distance to Infer the Accuracy of Genomic Prediction</title>
    <summary>  The prediction of phenotypic traits using high-density genomic data has many
applications such as the selection of plants and animals of commercial
interest; and it is expected to play an increasing role in medical diagnostics.
Statistical models used for this task are usually tested using
cross-validation, which implicitly assumes that new individuals (whose
phenotypes we would like to predict) originate from the same population the
genomic prediction model is trained on. In this paper we propose an approach
based on clustering and resampling to investigate the effect of increasing
genetic distance between training and target populations when predicting
quantitative traits. This is important for plant and animal genetics, where
genomic selection programs rely on the precision of predictions in future
rounds of breeding. Therefore, estimating how quickly predictive accuracy
decays is important in deciding which training population to use and how often
the model has to be recalibrated. We find that the correlation between true and
predicted values decays approximately linearly with respect to either $\F$ or
mean kinship between the training and the target populations. We illustrate
this relationship using simulations and a collection of data sets from mice,
wheat and human genetics.

    <title>Elastic Model for Dinucleosome Structure and Energy</title>
    <summary>  The equilibrium structure of a Dinucleosome is studied using an elastic model
that takes into account the force and torque balance conditions. Using the
proper boundary conditions, it is found that the conformational energy of the
problem does not depend on the length of the linker DNA. In addition it is
shown that the two histone octamers are almost perpendicular to each other and
the linker DNA in short lengths is almost straight. These findings could shed
some light on the role of DNA elasticity in the chromatin structure.

    <title>The networked partial correlation and its application to the analysis of
  genetic interactions</title>
    <summary>  Genetic interactions confer robustness on cells in response to genetic
perturbations. This often occurs through molecular buffering mechanisms that
can be predicted using, among other features, the degree of coexpression
between genes, commonly estimated through marginal measures of association such
as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients. However, marginal correlations
are sensitive to indirect effects and often partial correlations are used
instead. Yet, partial correlations convey no information about the (linear)
influence of the coexpressed genes on the entire multivariate system, which may
be crucial to discriminate functional associations from genetic interactions.
To address these two shortcomings, here we propose to use the edge weight
derived from the covariance decomposition over the paths of the associated gene
network. We call this new quantity the networked partial correlation and use it
to analyze genetic interactions in yeast.

    <title>A Weighted Exact Test for Mutually Exclusive Mutations in Cancer</title>
    <summary>  The somatic mutations in the pathways that drive cancer development tend to
be mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing
driver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This
mutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable
mutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for
exclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational
frequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision.
  We formulate a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of
mutational exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. Our test
conditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event,
per-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute
$p$-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and
efficient saddlepoint approximation of the test. We use our test to approximate
a commonly used permutation test for exclusivity that conditions on per-event,
per-sample mutation frequencies. However, our test is more efficient and it
recovers more significant results than the permutation test. We use our
Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to analyze hundreds of colorectal and
endometrial samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which are two cancer types
that often have extremely high mutation rates. On both cancer types, the
weighted test identifies sets of mutually exclusive mutations in cancer genes
with fewer false positives than earlier approaches.

    <title>DeepChrome: Deep-learning for predicting gene expression from histone
  modifications</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Histone modifications are among the most important factors that
control gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression
from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their
combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing
'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying
the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels
either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods
that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a
unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to
classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system,
called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among
important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions
among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique
that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides
an intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate
genes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models
like Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression
classification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output
of our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but
also allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone
modification marks, some of which have recently been observed by experimental
studies.

    <title>Analysis of Chromosome 20 - A Study</title>
    <summary>  Since the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies the amount of
genetic sequencing data has increased dramatically. This has has fueled an
increase in human genetics research. At the same time, with the recent advent
of technologies in processing large data sets, lot of these technologies are
proving valuable and efficient in analyzing these huge datasets. In this paper
we use some of these technologies to analyze genetic sequencing data of 1000
Genomes Project,produce and evaluate a framework to process the sequencing data
thereof and look into structural variations with respect to population groups.

    <title>Enhancing power of rare variant association test by Zoom-Focus Algorithm
  (ZFA) to locate optimal testing region</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Exome or targeted sequencing data exerts analytical challenge to
test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with extremely small minor allele
frequency (MAF). Various rare variant tests were proposed to increase power by
aggregating SNPs within a fixed genomic region, such as a gene or pathway.
However, a gene could contain from several to thousands of markers, and not all
of them may be related to the phenotype. Combining functional and
non-functional SNPs in arbitrary genomic region could impair the testing power.
Results: We propose a Zoom-Focus algorithm (ZFA) to locate the optimal testing
region within a given genomic region, as a wrapper function to be applied in
conjunction with rare variant association tests. In the first Zooming step, a
given genomic region is partitioned by order of two, and the best partition is
located within all partition levels. In the next Focusing step, boundaries of
the zoomed region are refined. Simulation studies showed that ZFA substantially
enhanced the statistical power of rare variant tests by over 10 folds,
including the WSS, SKAT and W-test. The algorithm is applied on real exome
sequencing data of hypertensive disorder, and identified biologically relevant
genetic markers to metabolic disorder that are undiscoverable by testing using
full gene. The proposed algorithm is an efficient and powerful tool to increase
the effectiveness of rare variant association tests for exome sequencing
datasets of complex disorder.

    <title>Using Sequence Ensembles for Seeding Alignments of MinION Sequencing
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is currently the smallest sequencing device
available. While being able to produce very long reads (reads of up to 100~kbp
were reported), it is prone to high sequencing error rates of up to 30%. Since
most of these errors are insertions or deletions, it is very difficult to adapt
popular seed-based algorithms designed for aligning data sets with much lower
error rates.
  Base calling of MinION reads is typically done using hidden Markov models. In
this paper, we propose to represent each sequencing read by an ensemble of
sequences sampled from such a probabilistic model. This approach can improve
the sensitivity and false positive rate of seeding an alignment compared to
using a single representative base call sequence for each read.

    <title>Reanalyzing variable directionality of gene expression in
  transgenerational epigenetic inheritance</title>
    <summary>  A previous report claimed no evidence of transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance in a mouse model of in utero environmental exposure, based on the
observation that gene expression changes observed in the germ cells of G1 and
G2 male fetus were not in the same direction. A subsequent data reanalysis
however showed a statistically significant overlap between G1 and G2 genes
irrespective of direction, leading to the suggestion that, as phenotypic
variability in epigenetic transmission has been observed in several other
examples also, the above report provided evidence in favor of, not against,
transgenerational inheritance. This criticism has recently been questioned.
Here, it is shown that the questions raised are based not only on incorrect
statistical calculations but also on wrong premise that gene expression changes
do not constitute a phenotype.

    <title>Optimal Down Regulation of mRNA Translation</title>
    <summary>  Down regulation of mRNA translation is an important problem in various
bio-medical domains ranging from developing effective medicines for tumors and
for viral diseases to developing attenuated virus strains that can be used for
vaccination. Here, we study the problem of down regulation of mRNA translation
using a mathematical model called the ribosome flow model (RFM). In the RFM,
the mRNA molecule is modeled as a chain of $n$ sites. The flow of ribosomes
between consecutive sites is regulated by $n+1$ transition rates. Given a set
of feasible transition rates, that models the outcome of all possible
mutations, we consider the problem of maximally down regulating the translation
rate by altering the rates within this set of feasible rates. Under certain
conditions on the feasible set, we show that an optimal solution can be
determined efficiently. We also rigorously analyze two special cases of the
down regulation optimization problem. Our results suggest that one must focus
on the position along the mRNA molecule where the transition rate has the
strongest effect on the protein production rate. However, this rate is not
necessarily the slowest transition rate along the mRNA molecule. We discuss
some of the biological implications of these results.

    <title>Characterization of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolates
  from Fitness Centers in Memphis Metropolitan Area, USA</title>
    <summary>  Indoor skin-contact surfaces of public fitness centers may serve as
reservoirs of potential human transmission of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We found a high prevalence of multi-drug
resistant (MDR)-MRSA of CC59 lineage harboring a variety of extracellular toxin
genes from surface swab samples collected from inanimate surfaces of fitness
centers in Memphis metropolitan area, USA. Our findings underscore the role of
inanimate surfaces as potential sources of transmission of MDR-MRSA strains
with considerable genetic diversity.

5-droxymethylcytosine (5hmC) belong to the most important epigenetic
modifications and their vital role in the regulation of gene expression has
been widely recognized. Recent experimental techniques allow to infer
methylation and hydroxylation levels at CpG dinucleotides but require a

    <title>Deep Learning in Bioinformatics</title>
    <summary>  In the era of big data, transformation of biomedical big data into valuable
knowledge has been one of the most important challenges in bioinformatics. Deep
learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in various fields. Accordingly, application of
deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized
in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics,
presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive
perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e.,
omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning
architecture (i.e., deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief
descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical
issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research
directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and
serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in
their bioinformatics studies.

    <title>SICLE: A high-throughput tool for extracting evolutionary relationships
  from phylogenetic trees</title>
    <summary>  We present the phylogeny analysis software SICLE (Sister Clade Extractor), an
easy-to-use, high- throughput tool to describe the nearest neighbors to a node
of interest in a phylogenetic tree as well as the support value for the
relationship. The application is a command line utility that can be embedded
into a phylogenetic analysis pipeline or can be used as a subroutine within
another C++ program. As a test case, we applied this new tool to the published
phylome of Salinibacter ruber, a species of halophilic Bacteriodetes,
identifying 13 unique sister relationships to S. ruber across the 4589 gene
phylogenies. S. ruber grouped with bacteria, most often other Bacteriodetes, in
the majority of phylogenies, but 91 phylogenies showed a branch-supported
sister association between S. ruber and Archaea, an evolutionarily intriguing
relationship indicative of horizontal gene transfer. This test case
demonstrates how SICLE makes it possible to summarize the phylogenetic
information produced by automated phylogenetic pipelines to rapidly identify
and quantify the possible evolutionary relationships that merit further
investigation. SICLE is available for free for noncommercial use at
http://eebweb.arizona.edu/sicle/.

RNA (miRNA) regulation recently discovered in Human and various other
eukaryotes as well as in archaea. Here, we have analyzed RNA-seq data obtained

previous studies performed on eukaryotes. We report observations of circRNAs in
RNA-seq data that are reproducible across multiple experiments performed with

    <title>An end-to-end assembly of the Aedes aegypti genome</title>
    <summary>  We present an end-to-end genome assembly of a female Aedes aegypti mosquito,
which spreads viral diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and
Zika to humans. The assembly is based on an earlier genome published in 2007
and improved in 2013. The new assembly has a scaffold N50 of 419Mb, with 96.9%
of the ungapped sequence anchored to chromosomes. We used the new assembly to
examine the conservation of A. aegypti chromosomes. Our results suggest that
synteny is strongly conserved between Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae. Comparison
to D. melanogaster highlights the extent to which the identity of entire
chromosome arms is preserved across dipterans.

    <title>Clustering and Classification of Genetic Data Through U-Statistics</title>
    <summary>  Genetic data are frequently categorical and have complex dependence
structures that are not always well understood. For this reason, clustering and
classification based on genetic data, while highly relevant, are challenging
statistical problems. Here we consider a highly versatile U-statistics based
approach built on dissimilarities between pairs of data points for
nonparametric clustering. In this work we propose statistical tests to assess
group homogeneity taking into account the multiple testing issues, and a
clustering algorithm based on dissimilarities within and between groups that
highly speeds up the homogeneity test. We also propose a test to verify
classification significance of a sample in one of two groups. A Monte Carlo
simulation study is presented to evaluate power of the classification test,
considering different group sizes and degree of separation. Size and power of
the homogeneity test are also analyzed through simulations that compare it to
competing methods. Finally, the methodology is applied to three different
genetic datasets: global human genetic diversity, breast tumor gene expression
and Dengue virus serotypes. These applications showcase this statistical
framework's ability to answer diverse biological questions while adapting to
the specificities of the different datatypes.

    <title>Cell lineage tracing using nuclease barcoding</title>
    <summary>  Lineage tracing, the determination and mapping of progeny arising from single
cells, is an important approach enabling the elucidation of mechanisms
underlying diverse biological processes ranging from development to disease. We
developed a dynamic sequence-based barcode for lineage tracing and have
demonstrated its performance in C. elegans, a model organism whose lineage tree
is well established. The strategy we use creates lineage trees based upon the
introduction of specific mutations into cells and the propagation of these
mutations to daughter cells at each cell division. We present an experimental
proof of concept along with a corresponding simulation and analytical model for
deeper understanding of the coding capacity of the system. By introducing
mutations in a predictable manner using CRISPR/Cas9, our technology will enable
more complete investigations of cellular processes.

    <title>Community Recovery in Graphs with Locality</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by applications in domains such as social networks and
computational biology, we study the problem of community recovery in graphs
with locality. In this problem, pairwise noisy measurements of whether two
nodes are in the same community or different communities come mainly or
exclusively from nearby nodes rather than uniformly sampled between all nodes
pairs, as in most existing models. We present an algorithm that runs nearly
linearly in the number of measurements and which achieves the information
theoretic limit for exact recovery.

    <title>Read Mapping on de Bruijn graph</title>
    <summary>  Background Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has dramatically enhanced our
ability to sequence genomes, but not to assemble them. In practice, many
published genome sequences remain in the state of a large set of contigs. Each
contig describes the sequence found along some path of the assembly graph,
however, the set of contigs does not record all the sequence information
contained in that graph. Although many subsequent analyses can be performed
with the set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as
informative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph. Currently, one
lacks practical tools to perform mapping on such graphs. Results Here, we
propose a formal definition of mapping on a de Bruijn graph, analyse the
problem complexity which turns out to be NP-complete, and provide a practical
solution.We propose a pipeline called GGMAP (Greedy Graph MAPping). Its novelty
is a procedure to map reads on branching paths of the graph, for which we
designed a heuristic algorithm called BGREAT (de Bruijn Graph REAd mapping
Tool). For the sake of efficiency, BGREAT rewrites a read sequence as a
succession of unitigs sequences. GGMAP can map millions of reads per CPU hour
on a de Bruijn graph built from a large set of human genomic reads.
Surprisingly, results show that up to 22% more reads can be mapped on the graph
but not on the contig set. Conclusions Although mapping reads on a de Bruijn
graph is complex task, our proposal offers a practical solution combining
efficiency with an improved mapping capacity compared to assembly-based mapping
even for complex eukaryotic data. Availability: github.com/Malfoy/BGREAT

    <title>Integrating epigenomic data and 3D genomic structure with a new measure
  of chromatin assortativity</title>
    <summary>  Network analysis is a powerful way of modeling chromatin interactions.
Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors
affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach, using
chromatin assortativity to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific
cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which
proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution
Promoter Capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse
embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction
networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the
chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the
association of these features to the topology of four chromatin interaction
networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network.
Polycomb Group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the
highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centred networks. We then ask which
features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters
and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the
actively elongating form of RNA Polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared to inactive
forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among
promoters, and between promoters and other elements have different
characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the
elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers
and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple
genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the
comparison of chromatin interaction networks.

    <title>Dynamic read mapping and online consensus calling for better variant
  detection</title>
    <summary>  Variant detection from high-throughput sequencing data is an essential step
in identification of alleles involved in complex diseases and cancer. To deal
with these massive data, elaborated sequence analysis pipelines are employed. A
core component of such pipelines is a read mapping module whose accuracy
strongly affects the quality of resulting variant calls.
  We propose a dynamic read mapping approach that significantly improves read
alignment accuracy. The general idea of dynamic mapping is to continuously
update the reference sequence on the basis of previously computed read
alignments. Even though this concept already appeared in the literature, we
believe that our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of this
approach.
  To evaluate the benefit of dynamic mapping, we developed a software pipeline
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas) that mimics different dynamic mapping
scenarios. The pipeline was applied to compare dynamic mapping with the
conventional static mapping and, on the other hand, with the so-called
iterative referencing - a computationally expensive procedure computing an
optimal modification of the reference that maximizes the overall quality of all
alignments. We conclude that in all alternatives, dynamic mapping results in a
much better accuracy than static mapping, approaching the accuracy of iterative
referencing.
  To correct the reference sequence in the course of dynamic mapping, we
developed an online consensus caller named OCOCO
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo). OCOCO is the first consensus caller
capable to process input reads in the online fashion.
  Finally, we provide conclusions about the feasibility of dynamic mapping and
discuss main obstacles that have to be overcome to implement it. We also review
a wide range of possible applications of dynamic mapping with a special
emphasis on variant detection.

    <title>Controlling the joint local false discovery rate is more powerful than
  meta-analysis methods in joint analysis of summary statistics from multiple
  genome-wide association studies</title>
    <summary>  In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of common diseases/traits, we
often analyze multiple GWASs with the same phenotype together to discover
associated genetic variants with higher power. Since it is difficult to access
data with detailed individual measurements, summary-statistics-based
meta-analysis methods have become popular to jointly analyze data sets from
multiple GWASs. In this paper, we propose a novel summary-statistics-based
joint analysis method based on controlling the joint local false discovery rate
(Jlfdr). We prove that our method is the most powerful summary-statistics-based
joint analysis method when controlling the false discovery rate at a certain
level. In particular, the Jlfdr-based method achieves higher power than
commonly used meta-analysis methods when analyzing heterogeneous data sets from
multiple GWASs. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superior power of our
method over meta-analysis methods. Also, our method discovers more associations
than meta-analysis methods from empirical data sets of four phenotypes. The
R-package is available at: http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/Jlfdr.html.

    <title>Dynamics of transcription-translation networks</title>
    <summary>  A theory for qualitative models of gene regulatory networks has been
developed over several decades, generally considering transcription factors to
regulate directly the expression of other transcription factors, without any
intermediate variables. Here we explore a class of models that explicitly
includes both transcription and translation, keeping track of both mRNA and
protein concentrations. We mainly deal with transcription regulation functions
that are steep sigmoids or step functions, as is often done in protein-only
models, though translation is governed by a linear term. We extend many aspects
of the protein-only theory to this new context, including properties of fixed
points, description of trajectories by mappings between switching points,
qualitative analysis via a state-transition diagram, and a result on periodic
orbits for negative feedback loops. We find that while singular behaviour in
switching domains is largely avoided, non-uniqueness of solutions can still
occur in the step-function limit.

    <title>ProtVec: A Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for
biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological
sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid
sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation
can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics.
In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a
wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification,
protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification,
and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial
neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense
n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of
324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein
families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93%+-0.06% is
obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we
use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured
proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database
as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich
with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine
classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein
sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8% accuracy, and
unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt
sequences with 100.0% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing
sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about
protein structure can be determined.

    <title>A resource-frugal probabilistic dictionary and applications in
  (meta)genomics</title>
    <summary>  Genomic and metagenomic fields, generating huge sets of short genomic
sequences, brought their own share of high performance problems. To extract
relevant pieces of information from the huge data sets generated by current
sequencing techniques, one must rely on extremely scalable methods and
solutions. Indexing billions of objects is a task considered too expensive
while being a fundamental need in this field. In this paper we propose a
straightforward indexing structure that scales to billions of element and we
propose two direct applications in genomics and metagenomics. We show that our
proposal solves problem instances for which no other known solution scales-up.
We believe that many tools and applications could benefit from either the
fundamental data structure we provide or from the applications developed from
this structure.

    <title>Transcriptional Similarity in Couples Reveals the Impact of Shared
  Environment and Lifestyle on Gene Regulation through Modified Cytosines</title>
    <summary>  Gene expression is a complex and quantitative trait that is influenced by
both genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors.
Evaluating the contribution of environment to gene expression regulation and
identifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental
factors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize
that by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes
that may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air
pollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived
from unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan,
Nigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us
to characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression
levels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show
much smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false
discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family
members in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a
random-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more
likely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in
couples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those
genes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the
relationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that
transcriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common
environment partially mediated through cytosine modifications.

    <title>A model for the clustered distribution of SNPs in the human genome</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by a non-random but clustered distribution of SNPs, we introduce a
phenomenological model to account for the clustering properties of SNPs in the
human genome. The phenomenological model is based on a preferential mutation to
the closer proximity of existing SNPs. With the Hapmap SNP data, we empirically
demonstrate that the preferential model is better for illustrating the
clustered distribution of SNPs than the random model. Moreover, the model is
applicable not only to autosomes but also to the X chromosome, although the X
chromosome has different characteristics from autosomes. The analysis of the
estimated parameters in the model can explain the pronounced population
structure and the low genetic diversity of the X chromosome. In addition,
correlation between the parameters reveals the population-wise difference of
the mutation probability. These results support the mutational non-independence
hypothesis against random mutation.

    <title>Abasy Atlas: A comprehensive inventory of systems, global network
  properties and systems-level elements across bacteria</title>
    <summary>  The availability of databases electronically encoding curated regulatory
networks and of high-throughput technologies and methods to discover regulatory
interactions provides an invaluable source of data to understand the principles
underpinning the organization and evolution of these networks responsible for
cellular regulation. Nevertheless, data on these sources never goes beyond the
regulon level despite the fact that regulatory networks are complex
hierarchical-modular structures still challenging our understanding. This
brings the necessity for an inventory of systems across a large range of
organisms, a key step to rendering feasible comparative systems biology
approaches. In this work, we take the first step towards a global understanding
of the regulatory networks organization by making a cartography of the
functional architectures of diverse bacteria. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems)
Atlas provides a comprehensive inventory of annotated functional systems,
global network properties, and systems-level elements (global regulators,
modular genes shaping functional systems, basal machinery genes, and
intermodular genes) predicted by the natural decomposition approach for
reconstructed and meta-curated regulatory networks across a large range of
bacteria, including pathogenically and biotechnologically relevant organisms.
The meta-curation of regulatory datasets provides the most complete and
reliable set of regulatory interactions currently available. Abasy Atlas
contains systems and system-level elements for 50 regulatory networks
comprising 78,649 regulatory interactions covering 42 bacteria in nine taxa,
containing 3,708 regulons and 1,776 systems. All this brings together a large
corpus of data that will surely inspire studies to generate hypothesis
regarding the principles governing the evolution and organization of systems
and the functional architectures controlling them.

    <title>Identifying and removing the cell-cycle effect from single-cell
  RNA-Sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a revolutionary technique for
discovering and describing cell types in heterogeneous tissues, yet its
measurement of expression often suffers from large systematic bias. A major
source of this bias is the cell cycle, which introduces large within-cell-type
heterogeneity that can obscure the differences in expression between cell
types. The current method for removing the cell-cycle effect is unable to
effectively identify this effect and has a high risk of removing other
biological components of interest, compromising downstream analysis. We present
ccRemover, a new method that reliably identifies the cell-cycle effect and
removes it. ccRemover preserves other biological signals of interest in the
data and thus can serve as an important pre-processing step for many scRNA-Seq
data analyses. The effectiveness of ccRemover is demonstrated using simulation
data and three real scRNA-Seq datasets, where it boosts the performance of
existing clustering algorithms in distinguishing between cell types.

    <title>The physics of epigenetics</title>
    <summary>  In higher organisms, all cells share the same genome, but every cell
expresses only a limited and specific set of genes that defines the cell type.
During cell division, not only the genome, but also the cell type is inherited
by the daughter cells. This intriguing phenomenon is achieved by a variety of
processes that have been collectively termed epigenetics: the stable and
inheritable changes in gene expression patterns. This article reviews the
extremely rich and exquisitely multi-scale physical mechanisms that govern the
biological processes behind the initiation, spreading and inheritance of
epigenetic states. These include not only the changes in the molecular
properties associated with the chemical modifications of DNA and histone
proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, but also less conventional ones,
such as the physics that governs the three-dimensional organization of the
genome in cell nuclei. Strikingly, to achieve stability and heritability of
epigenetic states, cells take advantage of many different physical principles,
such as the universal behavior of polymers and copolymers, the general features
of non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and the electrostatic and mechanical
properties related to chemical modifications of DNA and histones. By putting
the complex biological literature under this new light, the emerging picture is
that a limited set of general physical rules play a key role in initiating,
shaping and transmitting this crucial "epigenetic landscape". This new
perspective not only allows to rationalize the normal cellular functions, but
also helps to understand the emergence of pathological states, in which the
epigenetic landscape becomes dysfunctional.

    <title>Partial DNA Assembly: A Rate-Distortion Perspective</title>
    <summary>  Earlier formulations of the DNA assembly problem were all in the context of
perfect assembly; i.e., given a set of reads from a long genome sequence, is it
possible to perfectly reconstruct the original sequence? In practice, however,
it is very often the case that the read data is not sufficiently rich to permit
unambiguous reconstruction of the original sequence. While a natural
generalization of the perfect assembly formulation to these cases would be to
consider a rate-distortion framework, partial assemblies are usually
represented in terms of an assembly graph, making the definition of a
distortion measure challenging. In this work, we introduce a distortion
function for assembly graphs that can be understood as the logarithm of the
number of Eulerian cycles in the assembly graph, each of which correspond to a
candidate assembly that could have generated the observed reads. We also
introduce an algorithm for the construction of an assembly graph and analyze
its performance on real genomes.

    <title>Evolution of transcription factor families along the human lineage</title>
    <summary>  Transcription factors (TFs) exert their regulatory action by binding to DNA
with specific sequence preferences. However, different TFs can partially share
their binding sequences. This "redundancy" of binding defines a way of
organizing TFs in "motif families" that goes beyond the usual classification
based on protein structural similarities. Since the TF binding preferences
ultimately define the target genes, the motif family organization entails
information about the structure of transcriptional regulation as it has been
shaped by evolution. Focusing on the human lineage, we show that a
one-parameter evolutionary model of the Birth-Death-Innovation type can explain
the empirical repartition of TFs in motif families, thus identifying the
relevant evolutionary forces at its origin. More importantly, the model allows
to pinpoint few deviations in human from the neutral scenario it assumes: three
over-expanded families corresponding to HOX and FOX type genes, a set of
"singleton" TFs for which duplication seems to be selected against, and an
higher-than-average rate of diversification of the binding preferences of TFs
with a Zinc Finger DNA binding domain. Finally, a comparison of the TF motif
family organization in different eukaryotic species suggests an increase of
redundancy of binding with organism complexity.

    <title>Bayesian Genome- and Epigenome-wide Association Studies with Gene Level
  Dependence</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput genetic and epigenetic data are often screened for
associations with an observed phenotype. For example, one may wish to test
hundreds of thousands of genetic variants, or DNA methylation sites, for an
association with disease status. These genomic variables can naturally be
grouped by the gene they encode, among other criteria. However, standard
practice in such applications is independent screening with a universal
correction for multiplicity. We propose a Bayesian approach in which the prior
probability of an association for a given genomic variable depends on its gene,
and the gene-specific probabilities are modeled nonparametrically. This
hierarchical model allows for appropriate gene and genome-wide multiplicity
adjustments, and can be incorporated into a variety of Bayesian association
screening methodologies with negligible increase in computational complexity.
We describe an application to screening for differences in DNA methylation
between lower grade glioma and glioblastoma multiforme tumor samples from The
Cancer Genome Atlas. Software is available via the package BayesianScreening
for R at https://github.com/lockEF/BayesianScreening .

    <title>NRSSPrioritize: Associating Protein Complex and Disease Similarity
  Information to Prioritize Disease Candidate Genes</title>
    <summary>  The identification of disease-associated genes has recently gathered much
attention for uncovering disease complex mechanisms that could lead to new
insights into the treatment of diseases. For exploring disease-susceptible
genes, not only experimental approaches such as genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have been used, but also computational methods. Since experimental
approaches are both time-consuming and expensive, numerous studies have
utilized computational techniques to explore disease genes. These methods use
various biological data sources and known disease genes to prioritize disease
candidate genes. In this paper, we propose a gene prioritization method
(NRSSPrioritize), which benefits from both local and global measures of a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and also from disease similarity
knowledge to suggest candidate genes for colorectal cancer (CRC)
susceptibility. Network Propagation, Random Walk with Restart, and Shortest
Paths are three network analysis tools that are applied to a PPI network for
the purpose of scoring candidate genes. Also, by looking through diseases with
similar symptoms to CRC and obtaining their causing genes, candidate genes are
scored in a different way. Finally, to integrate these four different scoring
schemes, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods are applied to obtain
appropriate weights for the above four quantified measures and the weighted
summation of these measures are used to calculate the final score of each
candidate gene. NRSSPrioritize was validated by cross-validation analysis and
its results were compared with other prioritization tools, which gave the best
performance when using our proposed method.

    <title>HybridRanker: Integrating network structure and disease knowledge to
  prioritize cancer candidate genes</title>
    <summary>  One of the notable fields in studying the genetics of cancer is disease gene
identification which affects disease treatment and drug discovery. Many
researches have been done in this field. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
are one of them that focus on the identification of diseases-susceptible loci
on chromosomes. Recently, computational approaches, known as gene
prioritization methods have been used to identify candidate disease genes. Gene
prioritization methods integrate several data sources to discover and
prioritize the most probable candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose
a prioritization method, called HybridRanker which is a network-based technique
and it also uses experimental data to identify candidate cancer genes. We apply
our proposed method on colorectal cancer data. It is notable to say that in
HybridRanker, for considering both local and global network information of a
protein-protein interaction network, different algorithms such as
shortest-path, random walk with restart and network propagation are exploited.
By using these algorithms, initial scores are given to genes within the
network. Furthermore, by looking through diseases with similar symptoms and
also comorbid diseases and by extracting their causing genes, the gene scores
are recalculated. We also use gene-phenotype relations for an additional
scoring of the candidate genes. Our method is validated and compared with other
prioritization methods in leave one-out cross-validation and the comparison
results show the better performance of the HybridRanker.

    <title>Analysis of whole mitogenomes from ancient samples</title>
    <summary>  Ancient mitochondrial DNA has been used in a wide variety of palaeontological
and archaeological studies, ranging from population dynamics of extinct species
to patterns of domestication. Most of these studies have traditionally been
based on the analysis of short fragments from the mitochondrial control region,
analysed using PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing. With the introduction of
high-throughput sequencing, as well as new enrichment technologies, the
recovery of full mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from ancient specimens has
become significantly less complicated. Here we present a protocol to build
ancient extracts into Illumina high-throughput sequencing libraries, and
subsequent Agilent array-based capture to enrich for the desired mitogenome.
Both are based on previously published protocols, with the introduction of
several improvements aimed to increase the recovery of short DNA fragments,
while keeping the cost and effort requirements low. This protocol was designed
for enrichment of mitochondrial DNA in ancient or degraded samples. However,
the protocols can be easily adapted for using for building libraries for
shotgun-sequencing of whole genomes, or enrichment of other genomic regions.

    <title>Variational inference for rare variant detection in deep, heterogeneous
  next-generation sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  The detection of rare variants is important for understanding the genetic
heterogeneity in mixed samples. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have enabled the identification of single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) in mixed samples with high resolution. Yet, the noise inherent in the
biological processes involved in next-generation sequencing necessitates the
use of statistical methods to identify true rare variants. We propose a novel
Bayesian statistical model and a variational expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs
in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM
algorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more
computationally efficient on tests of low coverage ($27\times$ and $298\times$)
data. Furthermore, we show that our model with a variational EM inference
algorithm has higher specificity than many state-of-the-art algorithms. In an
analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to
identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel
variants that have not yet been reported. Our model also detects the emergence
of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a pair of
concomitant variants.

    <title>A frame-based representation of genomic sequences for removing errors
  and rare variant detection in NGS data</title>
    <summary>  We propose a frame-based representation of k-mers for detecting sequencing
errors and rare variants in next generation sequencing data obtained from
populations of closely related genomes. Frames are sets of non-orthogonal basis
functions, traditionally used in signal processing for noise removal. We define
a frame for genomes and sequenced reads to consist of discrete spatial signals
of every k-mer of a given size. We show that each k-mer in the sequenced data
can be projected onto multiple frames and these projections are maximized for
spatial signals corresponding to the k-mer's substrings. Our proposed
classifier, MultiRes, is trained on the projections of k-mers as features used
for marking k-mers as erroneous or true variations in the genome. We evaluate
MultiRes on simulated and real viral population datasets and compare it to
other error correction methods known in the literature. MultiRes has 4 to 500
times less false positives k-mer predictions compared to other methods,
essential for accurate estimation of viral population diversity and their
de-novo assembly. It has high recall of the true k-mers, comparable to other
error correction methods. MultiRes also has greater than 95% recall for
detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), fewer false positive SNPs,
while detecting higher number of rare variants compared to other variant
calling methods for viral populations. The software is freely available from
the GitHub link (https://github.com/raunaq-m/MultiRes).

    <title>Chloroplast Genome Yields Unusual Seven-Cluster Structure C</title>
    <summary>  We studied the structuredness in a chloroplast genome of Siberian larch. The
clusters in 63-dimensional space were identified with elastic map technique,
where the objects to be clusterized are the different fragments of the genome.
A seven-cluster structure in the distribution of those fragments reported
previously has been found. Unlike the previous results, we have found the
drastically other composition of the clusters comprising the fragments
extracted from coding and non-coding regions of the genome.

    <title>Accurate, Fast and Lightweight Clustering of de novo Transcriptomes
  using Fragment Equivalence Classes</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: De novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms is the
first major step for many RNA-seq analysis tasks. Current methods for de novo
assembly often report a large number of contiguous sequences (contigs), which
may be fractured and incomplete sequences instead of full-length transcripts.
Dealing with a large number of such contigs can slow and complicate downstream
analysis.
  Results :We present a method for clustering contigs from de novo
transcriptome assemblies based upon the relationships exposed by multi-mapping
sequencing fragments. Specifically, we cast the problem of clustering contigs
as one of clustering a sparse graph that is induced by equivalence classes of
fragments that map to subsets of the transcriptome. Leveraging recent
developments in efficient read mapping and transcript quantification, we have
developed RapClust, a tool implementing this approach that is capable of
accurately clustering most large de novo transcriptomes in a matter of minutes,
while simultaneously providing accurate estimates of expression for the
resulting clusters. We compare RapClust against a number of tools commonly used
for de novo transcriptome clustering. Using de novo assemblies of organisms for
which reference genomes are available, we assess the accuracy of these
different methods in terms of the quality of the resulting clusterings, and the
concordance of differential expression tests with those based on ground truth
clusters. We find that RapClust produces clusters of comparable or better
quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches, and does so substantially
faster. RapClust also confers a large benefit in terms of space usage, as it
produces only succinct intermediate files - usually on the order of a few
megabytes - even when processing hundreds of millions of reads.

    <title>Efficient Index Maintenance Under Dynamic Genome Modification</title>
    <summary>  Efficient text indexing data structures have enabled large-scale genomic
sequence analysis and are used to help solve problems ranging from assembly to
read mapping. However, these data structures typically assume that the
underlying reference text is static and will not change over the course of the
queries being made. Some progress has been made in exploring how certain text
indices, like the suffix array, may be updated, rather than rebuilt from
scratch, when the underlying reference changes. Yet, these update operations
can be complex in practice, difficult to implement, and give fairly pessimistic
worst-case bounds. We present a novel data structure, SkipPatch, for
maintaining a k-mer-based index over a dynamically changing genome. SkipPatch
pairs a hash-based k-mer index with an indexable skip list that is used to
efficiently maintain the set of edits that have been applied to the original
genome. SkipPatch is practically fast, significantly outperforming the dynamic
extended suffix array in terms of update and query speed.

    <title>Low-density locality-sensitive hashing boosts metagenomic binning</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomic binning is an essential task in analyzing metagenomic sequence
datasets. To analyze structure or function of microbial communities from
environmental samples, metagenomic sequence fragments are assigned to their
taxonomic origins. Although sequence alignment algorithms can readily be used
and usually provide high-resolution alignments and accurate binning results,
the computational cost of such alignment-based methods becomes prohibitive as
metagenomic datasets continue to grow. Alternative compositional-based methods,
which exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in
fragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods.
Inspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel
communication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based
binning method. It incorporates ideas from Gallager's low-density parity-check
code to design a family of compact and discriminative locality-sensitive
hashing functions that encode long-range compositional dependencies in long
fragments. By incorporating the Gallager LSH functions as features in a simple
linear SVM, Opal provides fast, accurate and robust binning for datasets
consisting of a large number of species, even with mutations and sequencing
errors. Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA,
an alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy
and robustness to sequencing errors. Opal also outperforms models built on
traditional k-mer profiles in terms of robustness and accuracy. Finally, we
demonstrate that we can effectively use Opal in the "coarse search" stage of a
compressive genomics pipeline to identify a much smaller candidate set of
taxonomic origins for a subsequent alignment-based method to analyze, thus
providing metagenomic binning with high scalability, high accuracy and high
resolution.

    <title>Multi-State Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution and Applications to
  Cancer Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from mixed populations has become
important in the study of cancer evolution, as sequencing is often performed on
bulk tumor tissue containing mixed populations of cells. Recent work has shown
how to reconstruct a perfect phylogeny tree from samples that contain mixtures
of two-state characters, where each character/locus is either mutated or not.
However, most cancers contain more complex mutations, such as copy-number
aberrations, that exhibit more than two states. We formulate the Multi-State
Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem of reconstructing a multi-state
perfect phylogeny tree given mixtures of the leaves of the tree. We
characterize the solutions of this problem as a restricted class of spanning
trees in a graph constructed from the input data, and prove that the problem is
NP-complete. We derive an algorithm to enumerate such trees in the important
special case of cladisitic characters, where the ordering of the states of each
character is given. We apply our algorithm to simulated data and to two cancer
datasets. On simulated data, we find that for a small number of samples, the
Multi-State Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem often has many
solutions, but that this ambiguity declines quickly as the number of samples
increases. On real data, we recover copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity,
single-copy amplification and single-copy deletion events, as well as their
interactions with single-nucleotide variants.

    <title>COCACOLA: binning metagenomic contigs using sequence COmposition, read
  CoverAge, CO-alignment, and paired-end read LinkAge</title>
    <summary>  The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enables
researchers to sequence complex microbial communities directly from
environment. Since assembly typically produces only genome fragments, also
known as contigs, instead of entire genome, it is crucial to group them into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further taxonomic profiling and
down-streaming functional analysis. OTU clustering is also referred to as
binning. We present COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs
into OTUs based upon sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples.
  The effectiveness of COCACOLA is demonstrated in both simulated and real
datasets in comparison to state-of-art binning approaches such as CONCOCT,
GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior performance of COCACOLA relies on two
aspects. One is employing $L_{1}$ distance instead of Euclidean distance for
better taxonomic identification during initialization. More importantly,
COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by
sparsity regularization.
  In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge
to facilitate binning accuracy. In our study, we have investigated two types of
additional knowledge, the co-alignment to reference genomes and linkage of
contigs provided by paired-end reads, as well as the ensemble of both. We find
that both co-alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the
majority of cases. COCACOLA is scalable and faster than CONCOCT ,GroopM, MaxBin
and MetaBAT.

    <title>Automated deconvolution of structured mixtures from bulk tumor genomic
  data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: As cancer researchers have come to appreciate the importance of
intratumor heterogeneity, much attention has focused on the challenges of
accurately profiling heterogeneity in individual patients. Experimental
technologies for directly profiling genomes of single cells are rapidly
improving, but they are still impractical for large-scale sampling. Bulk
genomic assays remain the standard for population-scale studies, but conflate
the influences of mixtures of genetically distinct tumor, stromal, and
infiltrating immune cells. Many computational approaches have been developed to
deconvolute these mixed samples and reconstruct the genomics of genetically
homogeneous clonal subpopulations. All such methods, however, are limited to
reconstructing only coarse approximations to a few major subpopulations. In
prior work, we showed that one can improve deconvolution of genomic data by
leveraging substructure in cellular mixtures through a strategy called
simplicial complex inference. This strategy, however, is also limited by the
difficulty of inferring mixture structure from sparse, noisy assays. Results:
We improve on past work by introducing enhancements to automate learning of
substructured genomic mixtures, with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy
number variation (CNV) data. We introduce methods for dimensionality estimation
to better decompose mixture model substructure; fuzzy clustering to better
identify substructure in sparse, noisy data; and automated model inference
methods for other key model parameters. We show that these improvements lead to
more accurate inference of cell populations and mixture proportions in
simulated scenarios. We further demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying
mixture substructure in real tumor CNV data. Availability: Source code is

    <title>Representing high throughput expression profiles via perturbation
  barcodes reveals compound targets</title>
    <summary>  High throughput mRNA expression profiling can be used to characterize the
response of cell culture models to perturbations such as pharmacologic
modulators and genetic perturbations. As profiling campaigns expand in scope,
it is important to homogenize, summarize, and analyze the resulting data in a
manner that captures significant biological signals in spite of various noise
sources such as batch effects and stochastic variation. We used the L1000
platform for large-scale profiling of 978 genes, chosen to be representative of
the genome as whole, across thousands of compound treatments. Here, a method is
described that uses deep learning techniques to convert the expression changes
of the landmark genes into a perturbation barcode that reveals important
features of the underlying data, performing better than the raw data in
revealing important biological insights. The barcode captures compound
structure and target information, in addition to predicting a compound's high
throughput screening promiscuity, to a higher degree than the original data
measurements, indicating that the approach uncovers underlying factors of the
expression data that are otherwise entangled or masked by noise. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that visualizations derived from the perturbation barcode can be
used to more sensitively assign functions to unknown compounds through a
guilt-by-association approach, which we use to predict and experimentally
validate the activity of compounds on the MAPK pathway. The demonstrated
application of deep metric learning to large-scale chemical genetics projects
highlights the utility of this and related approaches to the extraction of
insights and testable hypotheses from big, sometimes noisy data.

    <title>Accurate selfcorrection of errors in long reads using de Bruijn graphs</title>
    <summary>  New long read sequencing technologies, like PacBio SMRT and Oxford NanoPore,
can produce sequencing reads up to 50,000 bp long but with an error rate of at
least 15%. Reducing the error rate is necessary for subsequent utilisation of
the reads in, e.g., de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem has
been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a
hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second
generation sequencing technologies to correct the long reads. We present an
error correction method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two
phases: first we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de
Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k-mers, and second, the corrected reads
are further polished using long-distance dependencies that are found using
multiple alignments. According to our experiments the proposed method is the
most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets with high coverage.
Furthermore, when the coverage of the read set is at least 75x, the throughput
of the new method is at least 20% higher. LoRMA is freely available at

    <title>New algorithmic challenges of adaptive immune repertoire construction</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The analysis of antibodies and T-cell receptors (TCRs)
concentrations in serum is a fundamental problem in immunoinformatics.
Repertoire construction is a preliminary step of analysis of clonal lineages,
understanding of immune response dynamics, population analysis of
immunoglobulin and TCR loci. Emergence of MiSeq Illumina sequencing machine in
2013 opened horizons of investigation of adaptive immune repertoires using
highly accurate reads. Reads produced by MiSeq are able to cover repertoires of
moderate size. At the same time, throughput of sequencing machines increases
from year to year. This will enable ultra deep scanning of adaptive immune
repertoires and analysis of their diversity. Such data requires both efficient
and highly accurate repertoire construction tools. In 2015 Safonova et al.
presented IgRepertoireConstructor, a tool for accurate construction of antibody
repertoire and immunoproteogenomics analysis. Unfortunately, proposed algorithm
was very time and memory consuming and could be a bottleneck of processing
large immunosequencing libraries. In this paper we overcome this challenge and
present IgReC, a novel algorithm for adaptive repertoire construction problem.
IgReC reconstructs a repertoire with high precision even if each input read
contains sequencing errors and performs well on contemporary datasets. Results
of computational experiments show that IgReC improves state-of-the-art in the
field. Availability: IgReC is an open source and freely available program
running on Linux platforms. The source code is available at GitHub:

    <title>A phylogenetic latent feature model for clonal deconvolution</title>
    <summary>  Tumours develop in an evolutionary process, in which the accumulation of
mutations produces subpopulations of cells with distinct mutational profiles,
called clones. This process leads to the genetic heterogeneity widely observed
in tumour sequencing data, but identifying the genotypes and frequencies of the
different clones is still a major challenge. Here, we present Cloe, a
phylogenetic latent feature model to deconvolute tumour sequencing data into a
set of related genotypes. Our approach extends latent feature models by placing
the features as nodes in a latent tree. The resulting model can capture both
the acquisition and the loss of mutations, as well as episodes of convergent
evolution. We establish the validity of Cloe on synthetic data and assess its
performance on controlled biological data, comparing our reconstructions to
those of several published state-of-the-art methods. We show that our method
provides highly accurate reconstructions and identifies the number of clones,
their genotypes and frequencies even at a modest sequencing depth. As a proof
of concept we apply our model to clinical data from three cases with chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, and one case with acute myeloid leukaemia.

    <title>New Error Tolerant Method to Search Long Repeats in Symbol Sequences</title>
    <summary>  A new method to identify all sufficiently long repeating substrings in one or
several symbol sequences is proposed. The method is based on a specific gauge
applied to symbol sequences that guarantees identification of the repeating
substrings. It allows the matching of substrings to contain a given level of
errors. The gauge is based on the development of a heavily sparse dictionary of
repeats, thus drastically accelerating the search procedure. Some genomic
applications illustrate the method.
  This paper is the extended and detailed version of the presentation at the
third International Conference on Algorithms for Computational Biology to be
held at Trujillo, Spain, June 21-22, 2016.

    <title>The Discovery of Mutated Driver Pathways in Cancer: Models and
  Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  The pathogenesis of cancer in human is still poorly understood. With the
rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, huge volumes of
cancer genomics data have been generated. Deciphering those data poses great
opportunities and challenges to computational biologists. One of such key
challenges is to distinguish driver mutations, genes as well as pathways from
passenger ones. Mutual exclusivity of gene mutations (each patient has no more
than one mutation in the gene set) has been observed in various cancer types
and thus has been used as an important property of a driver gene set or
pathway. In this article, we aim to review the recent development of
computational models and algorithms for discovering driver pathways or modules
in cancer with the focus on mutual exclusivity-based ones.

    <title>Quantifying lymphocyte receptor diversity</title>
    <summary>  To recognize pathogens, B and T lymphocytes are endowed with a wide
repertoire of receptors generated stochastically by V(D)J recombination.
Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great
importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review
recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from
high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions
of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different
biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference
methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different
stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We
discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors
realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize
the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and
advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set
of recognized antigens.

    <title>DeepNano: Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Base Calling in MinION
  Nanopore Reads</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The MinION device by Oxford Nanopore is the first portable
sequencing device. MinION is able to produce very long reads (reads over
100~kBp were reported), however it suffers from high sequencing error rate. In
this paper, we show that the error rate can be reduced by improving the base
calling process.
  Results: We present the first open-source DNA base caller for the MinION
sequencing platform by Oxford Nanopore. By employing carefully crafted
recurrent neural networks, our tool improves the base calling accuracy compared
to the default base caller supplied by the manufacturer. This advance may
further enhance applicability of MinION for genome sequencing and various
clinical applications.

    <title>Higher order methylation features for clustering and prediction in
  epigenomic studies</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its
functional role is incompletely understood. Attempts to quantitatively
associate average DNA methylation to gene expression yield poor correlations
outside of the well-understood methylation-switch at CpG islands.
  Results: Here we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order
features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These
features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile,
capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using
these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to
construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression,
significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation
levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster
promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation
occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that
methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression.
Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial
correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such
features for downstream analyses.

    <title>Aligning 415 519 proteins in less than two hours on PC</title>
    <summary>  Rapid development of modern sequencing platforms enabled an unprecedented
growth of protein families databases. The abundance of sets composed of
hundreds of thousands sequences is a great challenge for multiple sequence
alignment algorithms. In the article we introduce FAMSA, a new progressive
algorithm designed for fast and accurate alignment of thousands of protein
sequences. Its features include the utilisation of longest common subsequence
measure for determining pairwise similarities, a novel method of gap costs
evaluation, and a new iterative refinement scheme. Importantly, its
implementation is highly optimised and parallelised to make the most of modern
computer platforms. Thanks to the above, quality indicators, namely
sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, show FAMSA to be superior to competing
algorithms like Clustal Omega or MAFFT for datasets exceeding a few thousand of
sequences. The quality does not compromise time and memory requirements which
are an order of magnitude lower than that of existing solutions. For example, a
family of 415 519 sequences was analysed in less than two hours and required
only 8GB of RAM.

    <title>SMISS: A protein function prediction server by integrating multiple
  sources</title>
    <summary>  SMISS is a novel web server for protein function prediction. Three different
predictors can be selected for different usage. It integrates different sources
to improve the protein function prediction accuracy, including the query
protein sequence, protein-protein interaction network, gene-gene interaction
network, and the rules mined from protein function associations. SMISS
automatically switch to ab initio protein function prediction based on the
query sequence when there is no homologs in the database. It takes fasta format
sequences as input, and several sequences can submit together without
influencing the computation speed too much. PHP and Perl are two primary
programming language used in the server. The CodeIgniter MVC PHP web framework
and Bootstrap front-end framework are used for building the server. It can be
used in different platforms in standard web browser, such as Windows, Mac OS X,
Linux, and iOS. No plugins are needed for our website. Availability:

    <title>Descriptive Statistics of the Genome: Phylogenetic Classification of
  Viruses</title>
    <summary>  The typical process for classifying and submitting a newly sequenced virus to
the NCBI database involves two steps. First, a BLAST search is performed to
determine likely family candidates. That is followed by checking the candidate
families with the Pairwise Sequence Alignment tool for similar species. The
submitter's judgement is then used to determine the most likely species
classification. The aim of this paper is to show that this process can be
automated into a fast, accurate, one-step process using the proposed
alignment-free method and properly implemented machine learning techniques.
  We present a new family of alignment-free vectorizations of the genome, the
generalized vector, that maintains the speed of existing alignment-free methods
while outperforming all available methods. This new alignment-free
vectorization uses the frequency of genomic words (k-mers), as is done in the
composition vector, and incorporates descriptive statistics of those k-mers'
positional information, as inspired by the natural vector.
  We analyze 5 different characterizations of genome similarity using
$k$-nearest neighbor classification, and evaluate these on two collections of
viruses totaling over 10,000 viruses. We show that our proposed method performs
better than, or as well as, other methods at every level of the phylogenetic
hierarchy.

    <title>A Posterior Probability Approach for Gene Regulatory Network Inference
  in Genetic Perturbation Data</title>
    <summary>  Inferring gene regulatory networks is an important problem in systems
biology. However, these networks can be hard to infer from experimental data
because of the inherent variability in biological data as well as the large
number of genes involved. We propose a fast, simple method for inferring
regulatory relationships between genes from knockdown experiments in the NIH
LINCS dataset by calculating posterior probabilities, incorporating prior
information. We show that the method is able to find previously identified
edges from TRANSFAC and JASPAR and discuss the merits and limitations of this
approach.

    <title>Reverse Engineering Gene Interaction Networks Using the Phi-Mixing
  Coefficient</title>
    <summary>  Constructing gene interaction networks (GINs) from high-throughput gene
expression data is an important and challenging problem in systems biology.
Existing algorithms produce networks that either have undirected and unweighted
edges, or else are constrained to contain no cycles, both of which are
biologically unrealistic. In the present paper we propose a new algorithm,
based on a concept from probability theory known as the phi-mixing coefficient,
that produces networks whose edges are weighted and directed, and are permitted
to contain cycles. Because there is no "ground truth" for genome-wide networks
on a human scale, we analyzed the outcomes of several experiments on lung
cancer, and matched the predictions from the inferred networks with
experimental results. Specifically, we inferred three networks (NSCLC,
Neuro-endocrine NSCLC plus SCLC, and normal) from the gene expression
measurements of 157 lung cancer and 59 normal cell lines, compared with the
outcomes of siRNA screening of 19,000+ genes on 11 NSCLC cell lines, and
analyzed data from a ChIP-Seq experiment to determine putative downstream
targets of the lineage specific oncogenic transcription factor ASCL1. The
inferred networks displayed a scale-free or power law behavior between the
degree of a node and the number of nodes with that degree. There was a strong
correlation between the degree of a gene in the inferred NSCLC network and its
essentiality for the survival of the cells. The inferred downstream
neighborhood genes of ASCL1 in the SCLC network were significantly enriched by
ChIP-Seq determined putative target genes, while no such enrichment was found
in the inferred NSCLC network.

    <title>Clustering genes of common evolutionary history</title>
    <summary>  Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using
data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events
such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be
misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions
have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.
Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies
might arise. Such "process-agnostic" approaches typically infer a tree for each
locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree
distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context
of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model
selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable
number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is
poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of
phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common
evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are
distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or
Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal
number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette
criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the
approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast
species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced
loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a new
program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).

    <title>Machine learning for metagenomics: methods and tools</title>
    <summary>  Owing to the complexity and variability of metagenomic studies, modern
machine learning approaches have seen increased usage to answer a variety of
question encompassing the full range of metagenomic NGS data analysis. We
review here the contribution of machine learning techniques for the field of
metagenomics, by presenting known successful approaches in a unified framework.
This review focuses on five important metagenomic problems: OTU-clustering,
binning, taxonomic profling and assignment, comparative metagenomics and gene
prediction. For each of these problems, we identify the most prominent methods,
summarize the machine learning approaches used and put them into perspective of
similar methods. We conclude our review looking further ahead at the challenge
posed by the analysis of interactions within microbial communities and
different environments, in a field one could call "integrative metagenomics".

    <title>Machine Learning for Protein Function</title>
    <summary>  Systematic identification of protein function is a key problem in current
biology. Most traditional methods fail to identify functionally equivalent
proteins if they lack similar sequences, structural data or extensive manual
annotations. In this thesis, I focused on feature engineering and machine
learning methods for identifying diverse classes of proteins that share
functional relatedness but little sequence or structural similarity, notably,
Neuropeptide Precursors (NPPs).
  I aim to identify functional protein classes solely using unannotated protein
primary sequences from any organism. This thesis focuses on feature
representations of whole protein sequences, sequence derived engineered
features, their extraction, frameworks for their usage by machine learning (ML)
models, and the application of ML models to biological tasks, focusing on high
level protein functions. I implemented the ideas of feature engineering to
develop a platform (called NeuroPID) that extracts meaningful features for
classification of overlooked NPPs. The platform allows mass discovery of new
NPs and NPPs. It was expanded as a webserver.
  I expanded our approach towards other challenging protein classes. This is
implemented as a novel bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET (Protein Feature
Engineering Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of biophysical and sequence
derived attributes, allowing the application of machine learning methods to
proteins. ProFET was applied on many protein benchmark datasets with state of
the art performance. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range of
high-level functions such as metagenomic analysis, subcellular localization,
structure and unique functional properties (e.g. thermophiles, nucleic acid
binding).
  These methods and frameworks represent a valuable resource for using ML and
data science methods on proteins.

    <title>Simulation based estimation of branching models for LTR retrotransposons</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: LTR retrotransposons are mobile elements that are able, like
retroviruses, to copy and move inside eukaryotic genomes. In the present work,
we propose a branching model for studying the propagation of LTR
retrotransposons in these genomes. This model allows to take into account both
positions and degradations of LTR retrotransposons copies. In our model, the
duplication rate is also allowed to vary with the degradation level.
  Results: Various functions have been implemented in order to simulate their
spread and visualization tools are proposed. Based on these simulation tools,
we show that an accurate estimation of the parameters of this propagation model
can be performed. We applied this method to the study of the spread of the
transposable elements ROO, GYPSY, and DM412 on a chromosome of
\textit{Drosophila melanogaster}.
  Availability: Our proposal has been implemented using Python software. Source
code is freely available on the web at
https://github.com/SergeMOULIN/retrotransposons-spread.

    <title>Approximation hardness of Shortest Common Superstring variants</title>
    <summary>  The shortest common superstring (SCS) problem has been studied at great
length because of its connections to the de novo assembly problem in
computational genomics. The base problem is APX-complete, but several
generalizations of the problem have also been studied. In particular, previous
results include that SCS with Negative strings (SCSN) is in Log-APX (though
there is no known hardness result) and SCS with Wildcards (SCSW) is
Poly-APX-hard. Here, we prove two new hardness results: (1) SCSN is
Log-APX-hard (and therefore Log-APX-complete) by a reduction from Minimum Set
Cover and (2) SCS with Negative strings and Wildcards (SCSNW) is NPOPB-hard by
a reduction from Minimum Ones 3SAT.

    <title>Primate specific retrotransposons, SVAs, in the evolution of networks
  that alter brain function</title>
    <summary>  The hominid-specific non-LTR retrotransposon termed SINE VNTR Alu (SVA) is
the youngest of the transposable elements in the human genome. The propagation
of the most ancient SVA type A took place about thirteen millions years ago
ago, and the youngest SVA types appeared in the human genome after the
chimpanzee divergence. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with
SVA insertions demonstrated their strong link to multiple ontological
categories attributed to brain function and the disorders. SVA types that
expanded their presence in the human genome at different stages of hominoid
life history were also associated with progressively evolving behavioural
features that indicated a potential impact of SVA propagation on a cognitive
ability of a modern human. The SVA-associated genes were highly cross-linked in
functional networks suggesting an accumulative impact of functional alterations
potentially caused by SVA insertions. Our analysis uncovered a potential role
of SVAs in evolution of human CNS and especially emergence of functional trends
relevant to social and parental behaviour. It also supports models which
explain in part how brain function can be modulated by both the immune and
reproductive systems based on the gene expression patterns and gene pathways
potentially altered by SVA insertions.

    <title>Construction of Gene and Species Trees from Sequence Data incl.
  Orthologs, Paralogs, and Xenologs</title>
    <summary>  Phylogenetic reconstruction aims at finding plausible hypotheses of the
evolutionary history of genes or species based on genomic sequence information.
The distinction of orthologous genes (genes that having a common ancestry and
diverged after a speciation) is crucial and lies at the heart of many genomic
studies. However, existing methods that rely only on 1:1 orthologs to infer
species trees are strongly restricted to a small set of allowed genes that
provide information about the species tree. The use of larger gene sets that
consist in addition of non-orthologous genes (e.g. so-called paralogous or
xenologous genes) considerably increases the information about the evolutionary
history of the respective species. In this work, we introduce a novel method to
compute species phylogenies based on sequence data including orthologs,
paralogs or even xenologs.

    <title>Visualizing Gene Ontology annotations</title>
    <summary>  Contemporary techniques in biology produce readouts for large numbers of
genes simultaneously, the typical example being differential gene expression
measurements. Moreover, those genes are often richly annotated using GO terms
that describe gene function and that can be used to summarize the results of
the genome-scale experiments. However, making sense of such GO enrichment
analyses may be challenging. For instance, overrepresented GO functions in a
set of differentially expressed genes are typically output as a flat list, a
format not adequate to capture the complexities of the hierarchical structure
of the GO annotation labels.
  In this chapter, we survey the various methods to visualize large,
difficult-to-interpret lists of GO terms. We catalogue their availability
(web-based or standalone), the main principles they employ in summarizing large
lists of GO terms, and the visualization styles they support. These brief
commentaries on each software are intended as a helpful inventory, rather than
comprehensive descriptions of the underlying algorithms. Instead, we show
examples of their use and suggest that the choice of an appropriate
visualization tool may be crucial to the utility of GO in biological discovery.

    <title>Accurate Liability Estimation Improves Power in Ascertained Case Control
  Studies</title>
    <summary>  Linear mixed models (LMMs) have emerged as the method of choice for
confounded genome-wide association studies. However, the performance of LMMs in
non-randomly ascertained case-control studies deteriorates with increasing
sample size. We propose a framework called LEAP (Liability Estimator As a
Phenotype, https://github.com/omerwe/LEAP) that tests for association with
estimated latent values corresponding to severity of phenotype, and demonstrate
that this can lead to a substantial power increase.

    <title>Malignant field signature analysis in biopsy samples at diagnosis
  identifies lethal disease in patients with localized Gleason 6 and 7 prostate
  cancer</title>
    <summary>  Overtreatment of early-stage low-risk prostate cancer (PC) patients
represents a significant problem in disease management and has socio-economic
implications. Development of genetic and molecular markers of clinically
significant disease in patients diagnosed with low grade localized PC would
have a major impact in disease management. A gene expression signature (GES) is
reported for lethal PC in biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis
from patients with Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors in a Swedish watchful waiting
cohort with up to 30 years follow-up. A 98-genes GES identified 89 and 100
percent of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in G7 and G6 patients,
respectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83 and 100 percent of all deaths events
were captured. Remarkably, the 98-genes GES appears to perform successfully in
patients stratification with as little as 2% of cancer cells in a specimen,
strongly indicating that it captures a malignant field effect in prostates
harboring cancer cells of different degrees of aggressiveness. In G6 and G7
tumors from PC patients of age 65 or younger, GES identified 86 percent of all
death events during the entire follow-up period. In G6 and G7 tumors from PC
patients of age 70 or younger, GES identified 90 percent of all death events 6
years after diagnosis. Classification performance of the reported in this study
98-genes GES of lethal PC appeared suitable to meet design and feasibility
requirements of a prospective 4 to 6 years clinical trial, which is essential
for regulatory approval of diagnostic and prognostic tests in clinical setting.
Prospectively validated GES of lethal PC in biopsy specimens of G6 and G7
tumors will help physicians to identify, at the time of diagnosis, patients who
should be considered for exclusion from active surveillance programs and who
would most likely benefit from immediate curative interventions.

    <title>Statistical modeling of isoform splicing dynamics from RNA-seq time
  series data</title>
    <summary>  Isoform quantification is an important goal of RNA-seq experiments, yet it
remains prob- lematic for genes with low expression or several isoforms. These
difficulties may in principle be ameliorated by exploiting correlated
experimental designs, such as time series or dosage response experiments. Time
series RNA-seq experiments, in particular, are becoming in- creasingly popular,
yet there are no methods that explicitly leverage the experimental design to
improve isoform quantification. Here we present DICEseq, the first isoform
quantification method tailored to correlated RNA-seq experiments. DICEseq
explicitly models the corre- lations between different RNA-seq experiments to
aid the quantification of isoforms across experiments. Numerical experiments on
simulated data sets show that DICEseq yields more accurate results than
state-of-the-art methods, an advantage that can become considerable at low
coverage levels. On real data sets, our results show that DICEseq provides
substan- tially more reproducible and robust quantifications, increasing the
correlation of estimates from replicate data sets by up to 10% on genes with
low or moderate expression levels (bot- tom third of all genes). Furthermore,
DICEseq permits to quantify the trade-off between temporal sampling of RNA and
depth of sequencing, frequently an important choice when planning experiments.
Our results have strong implications for the design of RNA-seq ex- periments,
and offer a novel tool for improved analysis of such data sets. Python code is

    <title>Coinami: A Cryptocurrency with DNA Sequence Alignment as Proof-of-work</title>
    <summary>  Rate of growth of the amount of data generated using the high throughput
sequencing (HTS) platforms now exceeds the growth stipulated by Moore's Law.
The HTS data is expected to surpass those of other "big data" domains such as
astronomy, before the year 2025. In addition to sequencing genomes for research
purposes, genome and exome sequencing in clinical settings will be a routine
part of health care. The analysis of such large amounts of data, however, is
not without computational challenges. This burden is even more increased due to
the periodic updates to reference genomes, which typically require re-analysis
of existing data. Here we propose Coin-Application Mediator Interface (Coinami)
to distribute the workload for mapping reads to reference genomes using a
volunteer grid computer approach similar to Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing (BOINC). However, since HTS read mapping requires substantial
computational resources and fast analysis turnout is desired, Coinami uses the
HTS read mapping as proof-of-work to generate valid blocks to main its own
cryptocurrency system, which may help motivate volunteers to dedicate more
resources. The Coinami protocol includes mechanisms to ensure that jobs
performed by volunteers are correct, and provides genomic data privacy. The
prototype implementation of Coinami is available at http://coinami.github.io/.

    <title>TwoPaCo: An efficient algorithm to build the compacted de Bruijn graph
  from many complete genomes</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: De Bruijn graphs have been proposed as a data structure to
facilitate the analysis of related whole genome sequences, in both a population
and comparative genomic settings. However, current approaches do not scale well
to many genomes of large size (such as mammalian genomes). Results: In this
paper, we present TwoPaCo, a simple and scalable low memory algorithm for the
direct construction of the compacted de Bruijn graph from a set of complete
genomes. We demonstrate that it can construct the graph for 100 simulated human
genomes in less then a day and eight real primates in less than two hours, on a
typical shared-memory machine. We believe that this progress will enable novel
biological analyses of hundreds of mammalian-sized genomes. Availability: Our

    <title>The dissection of expression quantitative trait locus hotspots</title>
    <summary>  Studies of the genetic loci that contribute to variation in gene expression
frequently identify loci with broad effect on gene expression: expression
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) hotspots. We describe a set of exploratory
graphical methods as well as a formal likelihood-based test for assessing
whether a given hotspot is due to one or multiple polymorphisms. We first look
at the pattern of effects of the locus on the expression traits that map to the
locus: the direction of the effects, as well as the degree of dominance. A
second technique is to focus on the individuals that exhibit no recombination
event in the region, apply dimensionality reduction (such as with linear
discriminant analysis) and compare the phenotype distribution in the
non-recombinants to that in the recombinant individuals: If the recombinant
individuals display a different expression pattern than the non-recombinants,
this indicates the presence of multiple causal polymorphisms. In the formal
likelihood-based test, we compare a two-locus model, with each expression trait
affected by one or the other locus, to a single-locus model. We apply our
methods to a large mouse intercross with gene expression microarray data on six
tissues.

    <title>Bayesian identification of bacterial strains from sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Rapidly assaying the diversity of a bacterial species present in a sample
obtained from a hospital patient or an evironmental source has become possible
after recent technological advances in DNA sequencing. For several applications
it is important to accurately identify the presence and estimate relative
abundances of the target organisms from short sequence reads obtained from a
sample. This task is particularly challenging when the set of interest includes
very closely related organisms, such as different strains of pathogenic
bacteria, which can vary considerably in terms of virulence, resistance and
spread. Using advanced Bayesian statistical modelling and computation
techniques we introduce a novel pipeline for bacterial identification that is
shown to outperform the currently leading pipeline for this purpose. Our
approach enables fast and accurate sequence-based identification of bacterial
strains while using only modest computational resources. Hence it provides a
useful tool for a wide spectrum of applications, including rapid clinical
diagnostics to distinguish among closely related strains causing nosocomial
infections. The software implementation is available at

    <title>MetaPalette: A $k$-mer painting approach for metagenomic taxonomic
  profiling and quantification of novel strain variation</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomic profiling is challenging in part because of the highly uneven
sampling of the tree of life by genome sequencing projects and the limitations
imposed by performing phylogenetic inference at fixed taxonomic ranks. We
present the algorithm MetaPalette which uses long $k$-mer sizes ($k=30, 50$) to
fit a $k$-mer "palette" of a given sample to the $k$-mer palette of reference
organisms. By modeling the $k$-mer palettes of unknown organisms, the method
also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary
relatedness of novel organisms present in the sample. The method returns a
traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently
simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also
returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference
sequences and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated
spike-ins and a metagenomic soil sample. The software implementing MetaPalette
is available at: https://github.com/dkoslicki/MetaPalette. Pre-trained
databases are included for Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and viruses.

    <title>A simple, general result for the variance of substitution number in
  molecular evolution</title>
    <summary>  The number of substitutions (of nucleotides, amino acids, ...) that take
place during the evolution of a sequence is a stochastic variable of
fundamental importance in the field of molecular evolution. Although the mean
number of substitutions during molecular evolution of a sequence can be
estimated for a given substitution model, no simple solution exists for the
variance of this random variable. We show in this article that the computation
of the variance is as simple as that of the mean number of substitutions for
both short and long times. Apart from its fundamental importance, this result
can be used to investigate the dispersion index R , i.e. the ratio of the
variance to the mean substitution number, which is of prime importance in the
neutral theory of molecular evolution. By investigating large classes of
substitution models, we demonstrate that although R\ge1 , to obtain R
significantly larger than unity necessitates in general additional hypotheses
on the structure of the substitution model.

    <title>Clustering pipeline for determining consensus sequences in targeted
  next-generation sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Analyses of targeted genomic sequencing data from next-generation-sequencing
(NGS) technologies typically involves mapping reads to a reference sequence or
clustering reads. For a number of species a reference genome is not available
so the analyses of targeted sequencing data, for example polymorphic structural
variation caused by mobile elements is difficult; clustering methods are
preferred for such data analysis. Clustering of reads requires a clustering
threshold parameter, which is used to compare and group reads. However,
determining the optimal clustering threshold for a read dataset is challenging
because of different sequence composition, the number of sequences present, and
also the amount of sequencing errors in the dataset. High values of the
clustering threshold parameter can falsely inflate the number of recovered
genomic regions, while low values of clustering threshold can merge reads from
distinct regions into a single cluster. Thus, an algorithm that can empirically
determine clustering threshold is needed. We propose a pipeline for clustering
genomic sequences wherein the clustering threshold is empirically determined
from the NGS data. The optimal threshold is decided based on two internal
clustering measures which assess clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and
large inter-cluster distances. We evaluate the pipeline on two simulated
datasets derived from human genome sequence simulating different genomic
regions and sequencing depth. The total number of clusters obtained from our
pipeline is closer to the actual number of reference sequences when compared to
single round of clustering. Also, the number of clusters whose consensus
sequence matches a corresponding reference sequence is higher in our pipeline.
We observe that the presence of repeat regions affects clustering accuracy.

    <title>TRONCO: an R package for the inference of cancer progression models from
  heterogeneous genomic data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: We introduce TRONCO (TRanslational ONCOlogy), an open-source R
package that implements the state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of
cancer progression models from (epi)genomic mutational profiles. TRONCO can be
used to extract population-level models describing the trends of accumulation
of alterations in a cohort of cross-sectional samples, e.g., retrieved from
publicly available databases, and individual-level models that reveal the
clonal evolutionary history in single cancer patients, when multiple samples,
e.g., multiple biopsies or single-cell sequencing data, are available. The
resulting models can provide key hints in uncovering the evolutionary
trajectories of cancer, especially for precision medicine or personalized
therapy.

    <title>RECKONER: Read Error Corrector Based on KMC</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Next-generation sequencing tools have enabled producing of huge
amount of genomic information at low cost. Unfortunately, presence of
sequencing errors in such data affects quality of downstream analyzes. Accuracy
of them can be improved by performing error correction. Because of huge amount
of such data correction algorithms have to: be fast, memory-frugal, and provide
high accuracy of error detection and elimination for variously-sized organisms.
  Results: We introduce a new algorithm for genomic data correction, capable of
processing eucaryotic 300 Mbp-genome-size, high error-rated data using less
than 4 GB of RAM in less than 40 minutes on 16-core CPU. The algorithm allows
to correct sequencing data at better or comparable level than competitors. This
was achieved by using very robust KMC~2 $k$-mer counter, new method of
erroneous regions correction based on both $k$-mer counts and FASTQ quality
indicators as well as careful optimization. Availability: Program is freely

    <title>Persisting fetal clonotypes influence the structure and overlap of adult
  human T cell receptor repertoires</title>
    <summary>  The diversity of T-cell receptors recognizing foreign pathogens is generated
through a highly stochastic recombination process, making the independent
production of the same sequence rare. Yet unrelated individuals do share
receptors, which together constitute a "public" repertoire of abundant
clonotypes. The TCR repertoire is initially formed prenatally, when the enzyme
inserting random nucleotides is downregulated, producing a limited diversity
subset. By statistically analyzing deep sequencing T-cell repertoire data from
twins, unrelated individuals of various ages, and cord blood, we show that
T-cell clones generated before birth persist and maintain high abundances in
adult organisms for decades, slowly decaying with age. Our results suggest that
large, low-diversity public clones are created during pregnancy, and survive
over long periods, providing the basis of the public repertoire.

    <title>Detection and Visualization of Differential Splicing in RNA-Seq Data
  with JunctionSeq</title>
    <summary>  Although RNA-Seq data provide unprecedented isoform-level expression
information, detection of alternative isoform regulation (AIR) remains
difficult, particularly when working with an incomplete transcript annotation.
We introduce JunctionSeq, a new method that builds on the statistical
techniques used by the well-established DEXSeq package to detect differential
usage of both exonic regions and splice junctions. In particular, JunctionSeq
is capable of detecting differentials in novel splice junctions without the
need for an additional isoform assembly step, greatly improving performance
when the available transcript annotation is flawed or incomplete. JunctionSeq
also provides a powerful and streamlined visualization toolset that allows
bioinformaticians to quickly and intuitively interpret their results. We tested
our method on publicly available data from several experiments performed on the
rat pineal gland and Toxoplasma gondii, successfully detecting known and
previously validated AIR genes in 19 out of 19 gene-level hypothesis tests. Due
to its ability to query novel splice sites, JunctionSeq is still able to detect
these differentials even when all alternative isoforms for these genes were not
included in the transcript annotation. JunctionSeq thus provides a powerful
method for detecting alternative isoform regulation even with low-quality
annotations. An implementation of JunctionSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor
package.

    <title>Identifying lineage effects when controlling for population structure
  improves power in bacterial association studies</title>
    <summary>  Bacteria pose unique challenges for genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
because of strong structuring into distinct strains and substantial linkage
disequilibrium across the genome. While methods developed for human studies can
correct for strain structure, this risks considerable loss- of-power because
genetic differences between strains often contribute substantial phenotypic
variability. Here we propose a new method that captures lineage-level
associations even when locus-specific associations cannot be fine-mapped. We
demonstrate its ability to detect genes and genetic variants underlying
resistance to 17 antimicrobials in 3144 isolates from four taxonomically
diverse clonal and recombining bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Strong
selection, recombination and penetrance confer high power to recover known
antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and reveal a candidate association between
the outer membrane porin nmpC and cefazolin resistance in E. coli. Hence our
method pinpoints locus-specific effects where possible, and boosts power by
detecting lineage-level differences when fine-mapping is intractable.

    <title>Primer on the Gene Ontology</title>
    <summary>  The Gene Ontology (GO) project is the largest resource for cataloguing gene
function. The combination of solid conceptual underpinnings and a practical set
of features have made the GO a widely adopted resource in the research
community and an essential resource for data analysis. In this chapter, we
provide a concise primer for all users of the GO. We briefly introduce the
structure of the ontology and explain how to interpret annotations associated
with the GO.

    <title>Gene Ontology: Pitfalls, Biases, Remedies</title>
    <summary>  The Gene Ontology (GO) is a formidable resource but there are several
considerations about it that are essential to understand the data and interpret
it correctly. The GO is sufficiently simple that it can be used without deep
understanding of its structure or how it is developed, which is both a strength
and a weakness. In this chapter, we discuss some common misinterpretations of
the ontology and the annotations. A better understanding of the pitfalls and
the biases in the GO should help users make the most of this very rich
resource. We also review some of the misconceptions and misleading assumptions
commonly made about GO, including the effect of data incompleteness, the
importance of annotation qualifiers, and the transitivity or lack thereof
associated with different ontology relations. We also discuss several biases
that can confound aggregate analyses such as gene enrichment analyses. For each
of these pitfalls and biases, we suggest remedies and best practices.

    <title>Evolutionary dynamics of selfish DNA generates pseudo-linguistic
  features of genomes</title>
    <summary>  Since the sequencing of large genomes, many statistical features of their
sequences have been found. One intriguing feature is that certain subsequences
are much more abundant than others. In fact, abundances of subsequences of a
given length are distributed with a scale-free power-law tail, resembling
properties of human texts, such as the Zipf's law. Despite recent efforts, the
understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking. Here we find that selfish
DNA elements, such as those belonging to the Alu family of repeats, dominate
the power-law tail. Interestingly, for the Alu elements the power-law exponent
increases with the length of the considered subsequences. Motivated by these
observations, we develop a model of selfish DNA expansion. The predictions of
this model qualitatively and quantitatively agree with the empirical
observations. This allows us to estimate parameters for the process of selfish
DNA spreading in a genome during its evolution. The obtained results shed light
on how evolution of selfish DNA elements shapes non-trivial statistical
properties of genomes.

    <title>Separating Putative Pathogens from Background Contamination with
  Principal Orthogonal Decomposition: Evidence for Leptospira in the Ugandan
  Neonatal Septisome</title>
    <summary>  Neonatal sepsis (NS) is responsible for over a 1 million yearly deaths
worldwide. In the developing world NS is often treated without an identified
microbial pathogen. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be
used to identify organisms that are difficult to detect by routine
microbiological methods. However, contaminating bacteria are ubiquitous in both
hospital settings and research reagents, and must be accounted for to make
effective use of these data. In the present study, we sequenced the bacterial
16S rRNA gene obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 80 neonates
presenting with NS to the Mbarara Regional Hospital in Uganda. Assuming that
patterns of background contamination would be independent of pathogenic
microorganism DNA, we applied a novel quantitative approach using principal
orthogonal decomposition to separate background contamination from potential
pathogens in sequencing data. We designed our quantitative approach contrasting
blood, CSF, and control specimens, and employed a variety of statistical random
matrix bootstrap hypotheses to estimate statistical significance. These
analyses demonstrate that Leptospira appears present in some infants presenting
within 48 hr of birth, indicative of infection in utero, and up to 28 days of
age, suggesting environmental exposure. This organism cannot be cultured in
routine bacteriological settings, and is enzootic in the cattle that the rural
peoples of western Uganda often live in close proximity. Our findings
demonstrate that statistical approaches to remove background organisms common
in 16S sequence data can reveal putative pathogens in small volume biological
samples from newborns. This computational analysis thus reveals an important
medical finding that has the potential to alter therapy and prevention efforts
in a critically ill population.

shotgun sequencing, where many randomly located fragments, called reads, are
extracted from the overall sequence, followed by an assembly algorithm that
aims to reconstruct the original sequence. There are many different
technologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods
create short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation
methods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error
profiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored
to specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,
a fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which
are robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.
  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads. We
make no assumption on the types of errors in the reads, but only assume a bound
on their magnitude. More precisely, for each read we assume that instead of
receiving the true read with no errors, we receive a corrupted read which has
edit distance at most $\epsilon$ times the length of the read from the true
read. We show that if the reads are long enough and there are sufficiently many
of them, then approximate reconstruction is possible: we construct a simple
algorithm such that for almost all original sequences the output of the
algorithm is a sequence whose edit distance from the original one is at most
$O(\epsilon)$ times the length of the original sequence.

    <title>Using runs of homozygosity to detect genomic regions associated with
  susceptibility to infectious and metabolic diseases in dairy cows under
  intensive farming conditions</title>
    <summary>  Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous stretches of homozygous genome
which likely reflect transmission from common ances- tors and can be used to
track the inheritance of haplotypes of interest. In the present paper, ROH were
extracted from 50K SNPs and used to detect regions of the genome associated
with susceptibility to diseases in a population of 468 Holstein-Frisian cows.
Diagnosed diseases were categorised as infectious diseases, metabolic
syndromes, mastitis, reproductive diseases and locomotive disorders. ROH
associated with infectious diseases, mastitis and locomotive disorders were
found on BTA 12. A long region of homozygosity linked with metabolic syndromes,
infectious and reproductive diseases was detected on BTA 15, disclosing complex
relationships between immunity, metabolism and functional disorders. ROH
associated with infectious and reproductive diseases, mastitis and metabolic
syndromes were observed on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 13 and 18. Previous studies
reported QTLs for milk production traits on all of these regions, thus
substantiating the known negative relationship between selection for milk
production and health in dairy cattle.

    <title>Rubbish DNA: The functionless fraction of the human genome</title>
    <summary>  Because genomes are products of natural processes rather than intelligent
design, all genomes contain functional and nonfunctional parts. The fraction of
the genome that has no biological function is called rubbish DNA. Rubbish DNA
consists of junk DNA, i.e., the fraction of the genome on which selection does
not operate, and garbage DNA, i.e., sequences that lower the fitness of the
organism, but exist in the genome because purifying selection is neither
omnipotent nor instantaneous. In this chapter, I (1) review the concepts of
genomic function and functionlessness from an evolutionary perspective, (2)
present a precise nomenclature of genomic function, (3) discuss the evidence
for the existence of vast quantities of junk DNA within the human genome, (4)
discuss the mutational mechanisms responsible for generating junk DNA, (5)
spell out the necessary evolutionary conditions for maintaining junk DNA, (6)
outline various methodologies for estimating the functional fraction within the
genome, and (7) present a recent estimate for the functional fraction of our
genome.

    <title>Inter-occurrence times and universal laws in finance, earthquakes and
  genomes</title>
    <summary>  A plethora of natural, artificial and social systems exist which do not
belong to the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical-mechanical world, based on the
standard additive entropy $S_{BG}$ and its associated exponential BG factor.
Frequent behaviors in such complex systems have been shown to be closely
related to $q$-statistics instead, based on the nonadditive entropy $S_q$ (with
$S_1=S_{BG}$), and its associated $q$-exponential factor which generalizes the
usual BG one. In fact, a wide range of phenomena of quite different nature
exist which can be described and, in the simplest cases, understood through
analytic (and explicit) functions and probability distributions which exhibit
some universal features. Universality classes are concomitantly observed which
can be characterized through indices such as $q$. We will exhibit here some
such cases, namely concerning the distribution of inter-occurrence (or
inter-event) times in the areas of finance, earthquakes and genomes.

    <title>Predicting the three-dimensional folding of cis-regulatory regions in
  mammalian genomes using bioinformatic data and polymer models</title>
    <summary>  The three-dimensional organisation of chromosomes can be probed using methods
such as Capture-C. However it is unclear how such population level data relates
to the organisation within a single cell, and the mechanisms leading to the
observed interactions are still largely obscure. We present a polymer modelling
scheme based on the assumption that chromosome architecture is maintained by
protein bridges which form chromatin loops. To test the model we perform FISH
experiments and also compare with Capture-C data. Starting merely from the
locations of protein binding sites, our model accurately predicts the
experimentally observed chromatin interactions, revealing a population of 3D
conformations.

    <title>Large Collection of Diverse Gene Set Search Queries Recapitulate Known
  Protein-Protein Interactions and Gene-Gene Functional Associations</title>
    <summary>  Popular online enrichment analysis tools from the field of molecular systems
biology provide users with the ability to submit their experimental results as
gene sets for individual analysis. Such queries are kept private, and have
never before been considered as a resource for integrative analysis. By
harnessing gene set query submissions from thousands of users, we aim to
discover biological knowledge beyond the scope of an individual study. In this
work, we investigated a large collection of gene sets submitted to the tool
Enrichr by thousands of users. Based on co-occurrence, we constructed a global
gene-gene association network. We interpret this inferred network as providing
a summary of the structure present in this crowdsourced gene set library, and
show that this network recapitulates known protein-protein interactions and
functional associations between genes. This finding implies that this network
also offers predictive value. Furthermore, we visualize this gene-gene
association network using a new edge-pruning algorithm that retains both the
local and global structures of large-scale networks. Our ability to make
predictions for currently unknown gene associations, that may not be captured
by individual researchers and data sources, is a demonstration of the potential
of harnessing collective knowledge from users of popular tools in the field of
molecular systems biology.

    <title>Towards a robust algorithm to determine topological domains from
  colocalization data</title>
    <summary>  One of the most important tasks in understanding the complex spatial
organization of the genome consists in extracting information about this
spatial organization, the function and structure of chromatin topological
domains from existing experimental data, in particular, from genome
colocalization (Hi-C) matrices. Here we present an algorithm allowing to reveal
the underlying hierarchical domain structure of a polymer conformation from
analyzing the modularity of colocalization matrices. We also test this
algorithm on several model polymer structures: equilibrium globules, random
fractal globules and regular fractal (Peano) conformations. We define what we
call a spectrum of cluster borders, and show that these spectra behave
strikingly differently for equilibrium and fractal conformations, allowing us
to suggest an additional criterion to identify fractal polymer conformations.

    <title>Expanded Distance-based Phylogenetic Analyses of Fossil Homo Skull Shape
  Evolution</title>
    <summary>  Analyses of a set of 47 fossil and 4 modern skulls using phylogenetic
geometric morphometric methods corroborate and refine earlier results. These
include evidence that the African Iwo Eleru skull, only about 12,000 years old,
indeed represents a new species of near human. In contrast, the earliest known
anatomically modern human skull, Qafzeh 9, the skull of Eve from
Israel/Palestine, is validated as fully modern in form. Analyses clearly show
evidence of archaic introgression into Gravettian, pre_Gravettian, Qafzeh, and
Upper Cave (China) populations of near modern humans, and in about that order
of increasing archaic content. The enigmatic Saldahna (Elandsfontein) skull
emerges as a probable first representative of that lineage, which exclusive of
Neanderthals that, eventually lead to modern humans. There is also evidence
that the poorly dated Kabwe (Broken Hill) skull represents a much earlier
distinct lineage. The clarity of the results bode well for quantitative
statistical phylogenetic methods making significant inroads in the stalemates
of paleoanthropology.

    <title>Limit Theorems for Empirical Rényi Entropy and Divergence with
  Applications to Molecular Diversity Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Quantitative methods for studying biodiversity have been traditionally rooted
in the classical theory of finite frequency tables analysis. However, with the
help of modern experimental tools, like high throughput sequencing, we now
begin to unlock the outstanding diversity of genomic data in plants and animals
reflective of the long evolutionary history of our planet. This molecular data
often defies the classical frequency/contingency tables assumptions and seems
to require sparse tables with very large number of categories and highly
unbalanced cell counts, e.g., following heavy tailed distributions (for
instance, power laws). Motivated by the molecular diversity studies, we propose
here a frequency-based framework for biodiversity analysis in the asymptotic
regime where the number of categories grows with sample size (an infinite
contingency table). Our approach is rooted in information theory and based on
the Gaussian limit results for the effective number of species (the Hill
numbers) and the empirical Renyi entropy and divergence. We argue that when
applied to molecular biodiversity analysis our methods can properly account for
the complicated data frequency patterns on one hand and the practical sample
size limitations on the other. We illustrate this principle with two specific
RNA sequencing examples: a comparative study of T-cell receptor populations and
a validation of some preselected molecular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
markers.

    <title>Functional transcription factor target discovery via compendia of
  binding and expression profiles</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide experiments to map the DNA-binding locations of
transcription-associated factors (TFs) have shown that the number of genes
bound by a TF far exceeds the number of possible direct target genes.
Distinguishing functional from non-functional binding is therefore a major
challenge in the study of transcriptional regulation. We hypothesized that
functional targets can be discovered by correlating binding and expression
profiles across multiple experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we
obtained ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from matching cell types from the human
ENCODE resource, considered promoter-proximal and distal cumulative regulatory
models to map binding sites to genes, and used a combination of linear and
non-linear measures to correlate binding and expression data. We found that a
high degree of correlation between a gene's TF-binding and expression profiles
was significantly more predictive of the gene being differentially expressed
upon knockdown of that TF, compared to using binding sites in the cell type of
interest only. Remarkably, TF targets predicted from correlation across a
compendium of cell types were also predictive of functional targets in other
cell types. Finally, correlation across a time course of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq
experiments was also predictive of functional TF targets in that tissue.

    <title>DNA-Level Splice Junction Prediction using Deep Recurrent Neural
  Networks</title>
    <summary>  A eukaryotic gene consists of multiple exons (protein coding regions) and
introns (non-coding regions), and a splice junction refers to the boundary
between a pair of exon and intron. Precise identification of spice junctions on
a gene is important for deciphering its primary structure, function, and
interaction. Experimental techniques for determining exon/intron boundaries
include RNA-seq, which is often accompanied by computational approaches.
Canonical splicing signals are known, but computational junction prediction
still remains challenging because of a large number of false positives and
other complications. In this paper, we exploit deep recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) to model DNA sequences and to detect splice junctions thereon. We test
various RNN units and architectures including long short-term memory units,
gated recurrent units, and recently proposed iRNN for in-depth design space
exploration. According to our experimental results, the proposed approach
significantly outperforms not only conventional machine learning-based methods
but also a recent state-of-the-art deep belief network-based technique in terms
of prediction accuracy.

    <title>MEEPTOOLS: A maximum expected error based FASTQ read filtering and
  trimming toolkit</title>
    <summary>  Next generation sequencing technology rapidly produces massive volume of data
and quality control of this sequencing data is essential to any genomic
analysis. Here we present MEEPTOOLS, which is a collection of open-source tools
based on maximum expected error as a percentage of read length (MEEP score) to
filter, trim, truncate and assess next generation DNA sequencing data in FASTQ
file format. MEEPTOOLS provides a non-traditional approach towards read
filtering/trimming based on maximum error probabilities of the bases in the
read on a non-logarithmic scale. This method simultaneously retains more
reliable bases and removes more unreliable bases than the traditional quality
filtering strategies.

    <title>MeFiT: Merging and Filtering Tool for Illumina Paired-End Reads for 16S
  rRNA Amplicon Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized genomic
research. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq
platform from Illumina, Inc., is being used to characterize the composition and
dynamics of extremely complex/diverse microbial communities. For this analysis
on the Illumina platform, merging and quality filtering of paired-end reads are
essential first steps in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of downstream analysis. We have developed the Merging and Filtering Tool
(MeFiT) to combine these pre-processing steps into one simple, intuitive
pipeline. MeFiT provides an open-source solution that permits users to merge
and filter paired end illumina reads based on user-selected quality parameters.
The tool has been implemented in python and the source-code is freely available
at https://github.com/nisheth/MeFiT.

    <title>Quantifying alternative splicing from paired-end RNA-sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  RNA-sequencing has revolutionized biomedical research and, in particular, our
ability to study gene alternative splicing. The problem has important
implications for human health, as alternative splicing may be involved in
malfunctions at the cellular level and multiple diseases. However, the
high-dimensional nature of the data and the existence of experimental biases
pose serious data analysis challenges. We find that the standard data summaries
used to study alternative splicing are severely limited, as they ignore a
substantial amount of valuable information. Current data analysis methods are
based on such summaries and are hence suboptimal. Further, they have limited
flexibility in accounting for technical biases. We propose novel data summaries
and a Bayesian modeling framework that overcome these limitations and determine
biases in a nonparametric, highly flexible manner. These summaries adapt
naturally to the rapid improvements in sequencing technology. We provide
efficient point estimates and uncertainty assessments. The approach allows to
study alternative splicing patterns for individual samples and can also be the
basis for downstream analyses. We found a severalfold improvement in estimation
mean square error compared popular approaches in simulations, and substantially
higher consistency between replicates in experimental data. Our findings
indicate the need for adjusting the routine summarization and analysis of
alternative splicing RNA-seq studies. We provide a software implementation in
the R package casper.

    <title>Detection of gene communities in multi-networks reveals cancer drivers</title>
    <summary>  We propose a new multi-network-based strategy to integrate different layers
of genomic information and use them in a coordinate way to identify driving
cancer genes. The multi-networks that we consider combine transcription factor
co-targeting, microRNA co-targeting, protein-protein interaction and gene
co-expression networks. The rationale behind this choice is that gene
co-expression and protein-protein interactions require a tight coregulation of
the partners and that such a fine tuned regulation can be obtained only
combining both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers of
regulation. To extract the relevant biological information from the
multi-network we studied its partition into communities. To this end we applied
a consensus clustering algorithm based on state of art community detection
methods. Even if our procedure is valid in principle for any pathology in this
work we concentrate on gastric, lung, pancreas and colorectal cancer and
identified from the enrichment analysis of the multi-network communities a set
of candidate driver cancer genes. Some of them were already known oncogenes
while a few are new. The combination of the different layers of information
allowed us to extract from the multi-network indications on the regulatory
pattern and functional role of both the already known and the new candidate
driver genes.

    <title>Nonparametric Reduced-Rank Regression for Multi-SNP, Multi-Trait
  Association Mapping</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide association studies have proven to be essential for understanding
the genetic basis of disease. However, many complex traits---personality
traits, facial features, disease subtyping---are inherently high-dimensional,
impeding simple approaches to association mapping. We developed a nonparametric
Bayesian reduced rank regression model for multi-SNP, multi-trait association
mapping that does not require the rank of the linear subspace to be specified.
We show in simulations and real data that our model shares strength over SNPs
and over correlated traits, improving statistical power to identify genetic
associations with an interpretable, SNP-supervised low-dimensional linear
projection of the high-dimensional phenotype. On the HapMap phase 3 gene
expression QTL study data, we identify pleiotropic expression QTLs that
classical univariate tests are underpowered to find and that two step
approaches cannot recover. Our Python software, BERRRI, is publicly available
at GitHub: https://github.com/ashlee1031/BERRRI.

    <title>Locating recombination hot spots in genomic sequences through the
  singular value decomposition</title>
    <summary>  Locating recombination hotspots in genomic data is an important but difficult
task. Current methods frequently rely on estimating complicated models at high
computational cost. In this paper we develop an extremely fast, scalable method
for inferring recombination hot spots in a population of genomic sequences that
is based on the singular value decomposition. Our method performs well in
several synthetic data scenarios. We also apply our technique to a real data
investigation of the evolution of drug therapy resistance in a population of
HIV genomic sequences. Finally, we compare our method both on real and
simulated data to a state of the art algorithm.

    <title>A Bayesian test to identify variance effects</title>
    <summary>  Identifying genetic variants that regulate quantitative traits, or QTLs, is
the primary focus of the field of statistical genetics. Most current methods
are limited to identifying mean effects, or associations between genotype and
the mean value of a quantitative trait. It is possible, however, that a genetic
variant may affect the variance of the quantitative trait in lieu of, or in
addition to, affecting the trait mean. Here, we develop a general
methodological approach to identifying covariates with variance effects on a
quantitative trait using a Bayesian heteroskedastic linear regression model. We
show that our Bayesian test for heteroskedasticity (BTH) outperforms classical
tests for differences in variation across a large range of simulations drawn
from scenarios common to the analysis of quantitative traits. We apply BTH to
methylation QTL study data and expression QTL study data to identify variance
QTLs. When compared with three tests for heteroskedasticity used in genomics,
we illustrate the benefits of using our approach, including avoiding
overfitting by incorporating uncertainty and flexibly identifying
heteroskedastic effects.

    <title>Multivariate Functional Regression Models for Epistasis Analysis</title>
    <summary>  To date, most genetic analyses of phenotypes have focused on analyzing single
traits or, analyzing each phenotype independently. However, joint epistasis
analysis of multiple complementary traits will increase statistical power, and
hold the key to understanding the complicated genetic structure of the complex
diseases. Despite their importance in uncovering the genetic structure of
complex traits, the statistical methods for identifying epistasis in multiple
phenotypes remains fundamentally unexplored. To fill this gap, we formulate a
test for interaction between two gens in multiple quantitative trait analysis
as a multiple functional regression (MFRG) in which the genotype functions
(genetic variant profiles) are defined as a function of the genomic position of
the genetic variants. We use large scale simulations to calculate its type I
error rates for testing interaction between two genes with multiple phenotypes
and to compare its power with multivariate pair-wise interaction analysis and
single trait interaction analysis by a single variate functional regression
model. To further evaluate its performance, the MFRG for epistasis analysis is
applied to five phenotypes and exome sequence data from the NHLBI Exome
Sequencing Project (ESP) to detect pleiotropic epistasis. A total of 136 pairs
of genes that formed a genetic interaction network showed significant evidence
of epistasis influencing five traits. The results demonstrate that the joint
interaction analysis of multiple phenotypes has much higher power to detect
interaction than the interaction analysis of single trait and may open a new
direction to fully uncovering the genetic structure of multiple phenotypes.

    <title>A New Statistical Framework for Genetic Pleiotropic Analysis of High
  Dimensional Phenotype Data</title>
    <summary>  The widely used genetic pleiotropic analysis of multiple phenotypes are often
designed for examining the relationship between common variants and a few
phenotypes. They are not suited for both high dimensional phenotypes and high
dimensional genotype (next-generation sequencing) data. To overcome these
limitations, we develop sparse structural equation models (SEMs) as a general
framework for a new paradigm of genetic analysis of multiple phenotypes. To
incorporate both common and rare variants into the analysis, we extend the
traditional multivariate SEMs to sparse functional SEMs. To deal with high
dimensional phenotype and genotype data, we employ functional data analysis and
the alternative direction methods of multiplier (ADMM) techniques to reduce
data dimension and improve computational efficiency. Using large scale
simulations we showed that the proposed methods have higher power to detect
true causal genetic pleiotropic structure than other existing methods.
Simulations also demonstrate that the gene-based pleiotropic analysis has
higher power than the single variant-based pleiotropic analysis. The proposed
method is applied to exome sequence data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project (ESP) with 11 phenotypes, which identifies a network with 137 genes
connected to 11 phenotypes and 341 edges. Among them, 114 genes showed
pleiotropic genetic effects and 45 genes were reported to be associated with
phenotypes in the analysis or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) related
phenotypes in the literature.

    <title>A New Approach for Scalable Analysis of Microbial Communities</title>
    <summary>  Microbial communities play important roles in the function and maintenance of
various biosystems, ranging from human body to the environment. Current methods
for analysis of microbial communities are typically based on taxonomic
phylogenetic alignment using 16S rRNA metagenomic or Whole Genome Sequencing
data. In typical characterizations of microbial communities, studies deal with
billions of micobial sequences, aligning them to a phylogenetic tree. We
introduce a new approach for the efficient analysis of microbial communities.
Our new reference-free analysis tech- nique is based on n-gram sequence
analysis of 16S rRNA data and reduces the processing data size dramatically (by
105 fold), without requiring taxonomic alignment. The proposed approach is
applied to characterize phenotypic microbial community differ- ences in
different settings. Specifically, we applied this approach in classification of
microbial com- munities across different body sites, characterization of oral
microbiomes associated with healthy and diseased individuals, and
classification of microbial communities longitudinally during the develop- ment
of infants. Different dimensionality reduction methods are introduced that
offer a more scalable analysis framework, while minimizing the loss in
classification accuracies. Among dimensionality re- duction techniques, we
propose a continuous vector representation for microbial communities, which can
widely be used for deep learning applications in microbial informatics.

the recent idea of pseudoalignment introduced in the RNA-Seq context is
suitable in the metagenomics setting. When coupled with the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, reads can be assigned far more
accurately and quickly than is currently possible with state of the art
software.

    <title>Pfcrmp May Play a Key Role in Chloroquine Antimalarial Action and
  Resistance Development</title>
    <summary>  It was proposed earlier that Pfcrmp (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine
resistance marker protein) may be the chloroquine's target protein in nucleus.
In this communication, further evidence is presented to support the view that
Pfcrmp may play a key role in chloroquine antimalarial actions as well as
resistance development.

    <title>Characterization of DNA methylation as a function of biological
  complexity via dinucleotide inter-distances</title>
    <summary>  We perform a statistical study of the distances between successive
occurrencies of a given dinucleotide in the DNA sequence for a number of
organisms of different complexity. Our analysis highlights peculiar features of
the dinucleotide CG distribution in mammalian DNA, pointing towards a
connection with the role of such dinucleotide in DNA methylation. While the CG
distributions of mammals exhibit exponential tails with comparable parameters,
the picture for the other organisms studied (e.g., fish, insects, bacteria and
viruses) is more heterogeneous, possibly because in these organisms DNA
methylation has different functional roles. Our analysis suggests that the
distribution of the distances between dinucleotides CG provides useful insights
in characterizing and classifying organisms in terms of methylation
functionalities.

    <title>Commet: comparing and combining multiple metagenomic datasets</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics offers a way to analyze biotopes at the genomic level and to
reach functional and taxonomical conclusions. The bio-analyzes of large
metagenomic projects face critical limitations: complex metagenomes cannot be
assembled and the taxonomical or functional annotations are much smaller than
the real biological diversity. This motivated the development of de novo
metagenomic read comparison approaches to extract information contained in
metagenomic datasets.
  However, these new approaches do not scale up large metagenomic projects, or
generate an important number of large intermediate and result files. We
introduce Commet ("COmpare Multiple METagenomes"), a method that provides
similarity overview between all datasets of large metagenomic projects.
  Directly from non-assembled reads, all against all comparisons are performed
through an efficient indexing strategy. Then, results are stored as bit
vectors, a compressed representation of read files, that can be used to further
combine read subsets by common logical operations. Finally, Commet computes a
clusterization of metagenomic datasets, which is visualized by dendrogram and
heatmaps.

    <title>MetaScope - Fast and accurate identification of microbes in metagenomic
  sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  MetaScope is a fast and accurate tool for analyzing (host-associated)
metagenome datasets. Sequence alignment of reads against the host genome (if
requested) and against microbial Genbank is performed using a new DNA aligner
called SASS. The output of SASS is processed so as to assign all microbial
reads to taxa and genes, using a new weighted version of the LCA algorithm.
MetaScope is the winner of the 2013 DTRA software challenge entitled "Identify
Organisms from a Stream of DNA Sequences".

    <title>The "Giant Virus Finder" Discovers an Abundance of Giant Viruses in the
  Antarctic Dry Valleys</title>
    <summary>  The first giant virus was identified in 2003 from a biofilm of an industrial
water-cooling tower in England. Later, numerous new giant viruses were found in
oceans and freshwater habitats, some of them having even 2,500 genes. We have
demonstrated their very likely presence in four soil samples taken from the
Kutch Desert (Gujarat, India). Here we describe a bioinformatics work-flow,
called the "Giant Virus Finder" that is capable to discover the very likely
presence of the genomes of giant viruses in metagenomic shotgun-sequenced
datasets. The new tool is applied to numerous hot and cold desert soil samples
as well as some tundra- and forest soils. We show that most of these samples
contain giant viruses, and especially many were found in the Antarctic dry
valleys. The results imply that giant viruses could be frequent not only in
aqueous habitats, but in a wide spectrum of soils on our planet.

    <title>Orthologs from maxmer sequence context</title>
    <summary>  Context-dependent identification of orthologs customarily relies on conserved
gene order or whole-genome sequence alignment. It is shown here that
short-range context--as short as single maximal matches--also provides an
effective means to identify orthologs within whole genomes. On pristine
(un-repeatmasked) mammalian whole-genome assemblies we perform a genome
"intersection" that in general consumes less than one thirtieth of the
computation time required by commonly used methods for whole-genome alignment,
and we extract "non-embedded maximal matches," maximal matches that are not
embedded into other maximal matches, as potential orthologs. An ortholog
identified via non-embedded maximal matches is analogous to a "positional
ortholog" or a "primary ortholog" as defined in previous literature; such
orthologs constitute homologs derived from the same direct ancestor whose
ancestral positions in the genome are conserved. At the nucleotide level,
non-embedded maximal matches recapitulate most exact matches identified by a
Lastz net alignment. At the gene level, reciprocal best hits of genes
containing non-embedded maximal matches recover one-to-one orthologs annotated
by Ensembl Compara with high selectivity and high sensitivity; these reciprocal
best hits additionally include putatively novel orthologs not found in Ensembl
(e.g. over two thousand for human/chimpanzee). The method is especially
suitable for genome-wide identification of orthologs.

    <title>Inferring selective constraint from population genomic data suggests
  recent regulatory turnover in the human brain</title>
    <summary>  The comparative genomics revolution of the past decade has enabled the
discovery of functional elements in the human genome via sequence comparison.
While that is so, an important class of elements, those specific to humans, is
entirely missed by searching for sequence conservation across species. Here we
present an analysis based on variation data among human genomes that utilizes a
supervised machine learning approach for the identification of human specific
purifying selection in the genome. Using only allele frequency information from
the complete low coverage 1000 Genomes Project dataset in conjunction with a
support vector machine trained from known functional and non-functional
portions of the genome, we are able to accurately identify portions of the
genome constrained by purifying selection. Our method identifies previously
known human-specific gains or losses of function and uncovers many novel
candidates. Candidate targets for gain and loss of function along the human
lineage include numerous putative regulatory regions of genes essential for
normal development of the central nervous system, including a significant
enrichment of gain of function events near neurotransmitter receptor genes.
These results are consistent with regulatory turnover being a key mechanism in
the evolution of human-specific characteristics of brain development. Finally,
we show that the majority of the genome is unconstrained by natural selection
currently, in agreement with what has been estimated from phylogenetic methods
but in sharp contrast to estimates based on transcriptomics or other
high-throughput functional methods.

    <title>Hot RAD: A Tool for Analysis of Next-Gen RAD Tag Data</title>
    <summary>  Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tagging (also known as RAD-seq, etc.)
is an emerging method for analyzing an organism's genome without completely
sequencing it. This can be applied to a non-model organism without a reference
genome, though this creates the problem of how to begin data analysis on
unmapped and unannotated reads. Our program, Hot RAD, presents a
straightforward and easy-to-use method to take raw Illumina data that has been
RAD tagged and produce consensus contigs or sequence stacks using a distributed
framework, creating a basis on which to begin analyzing an organism's DNA. The
GUI (graphical user interface) element of our tool makes it easy for those not
familiar with the command line to take raw sequence files and produce usable
data in a timely manner.

    <title>Cnidaria: fast, reference-free clustering of raw and assembled genome
  and transcriptome NGS data</title>
    <summary>  Background: Identification of biological specimens is a major requirement for
a range of applications. Reference-free methods analyse unprocessed sequencing
data without relying on prior knowledge, but generally do not scale to
arbitrarily large genomes and arbitrarily large phylogenetic distances.
Results: We present Cnidaria, a practical tool for clustering genomic and
transcriptomic data with no limitation on genome size or phylogenetic
distances. We successfully simultaneously clustered 169 genomic and
transcriptomic datasets from 4 kingdoms, achieving 100% identification accuracy
at supra-species level and 78% accuracy for species level. Discussion: CNIDARIA
allows for fast, resource-efficient comparison and identification of both raw
and assembled genome and transcriptome data. This can help answer both
fundamental (e.g. in phylogeny, ecological diversity analysis) and practical
questions (e.g. sequencing quality control, primer design).

    <title>Rare recombination events generate sequence diversity among balancer
  chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
    <summary>  Multiply inverted balancer chromosomes that suppress exchange with their
homologs are an essential part of the genetic toolkit in Drosophila
melanogaster. Despite their widespread use, the organization of balancer
chromosomes has not been characterized at the molecular level, and the degree
of sequence variation among copies of any given balancer chromosome is unknown.
To map inversion breakpoints and study potential sequence diversity in the
descendants of a structurally identical balancer chromosome, we sequenced a
panel of laboratory stocks containing the most widely used X-chromosome
balancer, First Multiple 7 (FM7). We mapped the locations of FM7 breakpoints to
precise euchromatic coordinates and identified the flanking sequence of
breakpoints in heterochromatic regions. Analysis of SNP variation revealed
megabase-scale blocks of sequence divergence among currently used FM7 stocks.
We present evidence that this divergence arose by rare double crossover events
that replaced a female-sterile allele of the singed gene (sn[X2]) on FM7c with
wild type sequence from balanced chromosomes, and propose that many FM7c
chromosomes in the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center have lost sn[X2] by this
mechanism. Finally, we characterize the original allele of the Bar gene (B[1])
that is carried on FM7 and validate the hypothesis that the origin and
subsequent reversion of the B1 duplication is mediated by unequal exchange. Our
results reject a simple non-recombining, clonal mode for the laboratory
evolution of balancer chromosomes and have implications for how balancer
chromosomes should be used in the design and interpretation of genetic
experiments in Drosophila.

    <title>NASCUP: Nucleic Acid Sequence Classification by Universal Probability</title>
    <summary>  Motivated by the need for fast and accurate classification of unlabeled
nucleotide sequences on a large scale, we propose a new classification method
that captures the probabilistic structure of a sequence family as a compact
context-tree model and uses it efficiently to test proximity and membership of
a query sequence. The proposed nucleic acid sequence classification by
universal probability (NASCUP) method crucially utilizes the notion of
universal probability from information theory in model-building and
classification processes, delivering BLAST-like accuracy in orders-of-magnitude
reduced runtime for large-scale databases. A comprehensive experimental study
involving seven public databases for functional non-coding RNA classification
and microbial taxonomy classification demonstrates the advantages of NASCUP
over widely-used alternatives in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across
all datasets considered. [availability: http://data.snu.ac.kr/nascup]

    <title>maigesPack: A Computational Environment for Microarray Data Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Microarray technology is still an important way to assess gene expression in
molecular biology, mainly because it measures expression profiles for thousands
of genes simultaneously, what makes this technology a good option for some
studies focused on systems biology. One of its main problem is complexity of
experimental procedure, presenting several sources of variability, hindering
statistical modeling. So far, there is no standard protocol for generation and
evaluation of microarray data. To mitigate the analysis process this paper
presents an R package, named maigesPack, that helps with data organization.
Besides that, it makes data analysis process more robust, reliable and
reproducible. Also, maigesPack aggregates several data analysis procedures
reported in literature, for instance: cluster analysis, differential
expression, supervised classifiers, relevance networks and functional
classification of gene groups or gene networks.

    <title>Negative selection maintains transcription factor binding motifs in
  human cancer</title>
    <summary>  Somatic mutations in cancer cells affect various genomic elements disrupting
important cell functions. In particular, mutations in DNA binding sites
recognized by transcription factors can alter regulator binding affinities and
expression of target genes. A number of promoter mutations have been linked
with an increased risk of cancer, mutations in binding sites of selected
transcription factors have been found under positive selection. However,
negative selection of mutations in coding regions is elusive and significance
of negative selection in non-coding regions remains controversial.
  Here we present analysis of transcription factors with binding sites
co-localized with non-coding variants. To avoid statistical bias we account for
mutation signatures of different cancer types. For many transcription factors,
including multiple members of FOX, HOX, and NR families, we show that human
cancers accumulate fewer mutations than expected by chance that increase or
decrease affinity of binding motifs. Such conservation of motifs is even more
exhibited in DNase accessible regions.
  Our data demonstrate negative selection against binding sites alterations and
suggest that this selection pressure protects cancer cells from rewiring of
regulatory circuits. Further analysis of transcription factors and the
respective conserved binding motifs can reveal cell regulatory pathways crucial
for the survivability of various human cancers.

    <title>Binding of bivalent transcription factors to active and inactive regions
  folds human chromosomes into loops, rosettes and domains</title>
    <summary>  Biophysicists are modeling conformations of interphase chromosomes, often
basing the strengths of interactions between segments distant on the genetic
map on contact frequencies determined experimentally. Here, instead, we develop
a fitting-free, minimal model: bivalent red and green "transcription factors"
bind to cognate sites in runs of beads ("chromatin") to form molecular bridges
stabilizing loops. In the absence of additional explicit forces, molecular
dynamic simulations reveal that bound "factors' spontaneously cluster -- red
with red, green with green, but rarely red with green -- to give structures
reminiscent of transcription factories. Binding of just two transcription
factors (or proteins) to active and inactive regions of human chromosomes
yields rosettes, topological domains, and contact maps much like those seen
experimentally. This emergent "bridging-induced attraction" proves to be a
robust, simple, and generic force able to organize interphase chromosomes at
all scales.

    <title>Multiscale Topology of Chromatin Folding</title>
    <summary>  The three dimensional structure of DNA in the nucleus (chromatin) plays an
important role in many cellular processes. Recent experimental advances have
led to high-throughput methods of capturing information about chromatin
conformation on genome-wide scales. New models are needed to quantitatively
interpret this data at a global scale. Here we introduce the use of tools from
topological data analysis to study chromatin conformation. We use persistent
homology to identify and characterize conserved loops and voids in contact map
data and identify scales of interaction. We demonstrate the utility of the
approach on simulated data and then look data from both a bacterial genome and
a human cell line. We identify substantial multiscale topology in these
datasets.

    <title>repgenHMM: a dynamic programming tool to infer the rules of immune
  receptor generation from sequence data</title>
    <summary>  The diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random
rearrangements of the receptor gene during early T and B cell development.
Rearrangement scenarios are composed of random events -- choices of gene
templates, base pair deletions and insertions -- described by probability
distributions. Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor
sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the
distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the
immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from
receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating
every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a
Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can
generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on
the Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the
different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on
sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To
test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences
produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be
accurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to
generate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any
receptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We
estimate this diversity to be $\approx 10^{23}$ for human T cells. The model
gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune
repertoires.

    <title>Phenotypic divergence of Homo sapiens is driven by the evolution of
  human-specific genomic regulatory networks via two mechanistically distinct
  pathways of creation of divergent regulatory DNA sequences</title>
    <summary>  Thousands of candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) have been
identified, supporting the hypothesis that unique to human phenotypes result
from human-specific alterations of genomic regulatory networks. Here,
conservation patterns analysis of 18,364 candidate HSRS was carried out based
on definition of the sequence conservation threshold as the minimum ratio of
bases that must remap of 1.00. A total of 5,535 candidate HSRS were identified
that are: i) highly conserved in Great Apes; ii) evolved by the exaptation of
highly conserved ancestral DNA; iii) defined by either the acceleration of
mutation rates on the human lineage or the functional divergence from nonhuman
primates. The exaptation of highly conserved ancestral DNA pathway seems
mechanistically distinct from the evolution of regulatory DNA segments driven
by the species-specific expansion of transposable elements. Present analysis
supports the idea that phenotypic divergence of Homo sapiens is driven by the
evolution of human-specific genomic regulatory networks via two mechanistically
distinct pathways of creation of divergent sequences of regulatory DNA: i)
exaptation of the highly conserved ancestral regulatory DNA segments; ii)
human-specific insertions of transposable elements.

    <title>Detecting "protein words" through unsupervised word segmentation</title>
    <summary>  Unsupervised word segmentation methods were applied to analyze the protein
sequence. Protein sequences, such as 'MTMDKSELVQKA...', were used as input to
these methods. Segmented 'protein word' sequences, such as 'MTM DKSE LVQKA',
were then obtained. We compare the 'protein words' produced by unsupervised
segmentation and the protein secondary structure segmentation. An interesting
finding is that the unsupervised word segmentation is more efficient than
secondary structure segmentation in expressing information. Our experiment also
suggests there may be some 'protein ruins' in current noncoding regions.

    <title>Hidden Markov Models for Gene Sequence Classification: Classifying the
  VSG genes in the Trypanosoma brucei Genome</title>
    <summary>  The article presents an application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for
pattern recognition on genome sequences. We apply HMM for identifying genes
encoding the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) in the genomes of Trypanosoma
brucei (T. brucei) and other African trypanosomes. These are parasitic protozoa
causative agents of sleeping sickness and several diseases in domestic and wild
animals. These parasites have a peculiar strategy to evade the host's immune
system that consists in periodically changing their predominant cellular
surface protein (VSG). The motivation for using patterns recognition methods to
identify these genes, instead of traditional homology based ones, is that the
levels of sequence identity (amino acid and DNA sequence) amongst these genes
is often below of what is considered reliable in these methods. Among pattern
recognition approaches, HMM are particularly suitable to tackle this problem
because they can handle more naturally the determination of gene edges. We
evaluate the performance of the model using different number of states in the
Markov model, as well as several performance metrics. The model is applied
using public genomic data. Our empirical results show that the VSG genes on T.
brucei can be safely identified (high sensitivity and low rate of false
positives) using HMM.

    <title>A large scale prediction of bacteriocin gene blocks suggests a wide
  functional spectrum for bacteriocins</title>
    <summary>  Bacteriocins are peptide-derived molecules produced by bacteria, whose
recently-discovered functions include virulence factors and signalling
molecules as well as their better known roles as antibiotics. To date, close to
five hundred bacteriocins have been identified and classified. Recent
discoveries have shown that bacteriocins are highly diverse and widely
distributed among bacterial species. Given the heterogeneity of bacteriocin
compounds, many tools struggle with identifying novel bacteriocins due to their
vast sequence and structural diversity. Many bacteriocins undergo
post-translational processing or modifications necessary for the biosynthesis
of the final mature form. Enzymatic modification of bacteriocins as well as
their export is achieved by proteins whose genes are often located in a
discrete gene cluster proximal to the bacteriocin precursor gene, referred to
as \textit{context genes} in this study. Although bacteriocins themselves are
structurally diverse, context genes have been shown to be largely conserved
across unrelated species. Using this knowledge, we set out to identify new
candidates for context genes which may clarify how bacteriocins are
synthesized, and identify new candidates for bacteriocins that bear no sequence
similarity to known toxins. To achieve these goals, we have developed a
software tool, Bacteriocin Operon and gene block Associator (BOA) that can
identify homologous bacteriocin associated gene clusters and predict novel
ones. We discover that several phyla have a strong preference for bactericon
genes, suggesting distinct functions for this group of molecules. Availability:

    <title>Cloning and Preliminary Characterization of STY46 from Arabidopsis
  thaliana, a Candidate Protein Kinase Involved in the Plant Sugar Starvation
  Response</title>
    <summary>  To study how plants respond to conditions under which the carbohydrates
needed for growth and development are exhausted, this project focuses on
cloning and functional characterization of a cytosolic protein kinase, STY46
that may potentially be involved in the sugar starvation response (SSR).
Generating A. thaliana STY46 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) lines is the
main method in this project to determine the function of the protein. A SALK
line (SALK116340) was confirmed to contain a TDNA insert in the STY46 gene and
the aim was to prove that this reduced the expression of this gene. Highly
intact RNA was isolated and reverse transcription PCR performed to determine
the level of transcript of STY46 in STY46KO. However the results were
inconclusive. This may be due to not enough amount of RNA use for the cDNA
reverse transcription. To develop an overexpression line, STY46 was cloned from
wild type Arabidopsis genotype. Primers were designed to flank the open read
frame of the STY46. They also contained restriction enzyme recognition sites
and a myctag engineered at their 5' ends to facilitate subsequent synthesis of
a plant transformation construct. A cDNA fragment of the expected size was
successfully amplified by PCR.

    <title>Unified theory of human genome reveals a constrained spatial chromosomal
  arrangement in interphase nuclei</title>
    <summary>  We investigate a densely packed, non-random arrangement of forty-six
chromosomes (46,XY) in human nuclei. Here, we model systems-level chromosomal
crosstalk by unifying intrinsic parameters (chromosomal length and number of
genes) across all pairs of chromosomes in the genome to derive an extrinsic
parameter called effective gene density. The hierarchical clustering and
underlying degeneracy in the effective gene density space reveal systems-level
constraints for spatial arrangement of clusters of chromosomes that were
previously unknown. Our findings corroborate experimental data on spatial
chromosomal arrangement in human nuclei, from fibroblast and lymphocyte cell
lines, thereby establishing that human genome constrains chromosomal
arrangement. We propose that this unified theory, which requires no additional
experimental input, may be extended to other eukaryotic species with annotated
genomes to infer their constrained self-organized spatial arrangement of
chromosomes.

    <title>An Entropy-Based Technique for Classifying Bacterial Chromosomes
  According to Synonymous Codon Usage</title>
    <summary>  We present a framework based on conditional entropy and the Dirichlet
distribution for classifying chromosomes based on the degree to which they use
synonymous codons uniformly or preferentially, that is, whether or not codons
that code for an amino acid appear with the same relative frequency. Applying
the approach to a large collection of annotated bacterial chromosomes reveals
three distinct groups of bacteria.

    <title>The Transcription Factor E4F1 Coordinates CHK1-Dependent Checkpoint and
  Mitochondrial Functions</title>
    <summary>  Recent data support the notion that a group of key transcriptional regulators
involved in tumorigenesis, including MYC, p53, E2F1, and BMI1, share an
intriguing capacity to simultaneously regulate metabolism and cell cycle. Here,
we show that another factor, the multifunctional protein E4F1, directly
controls genes involved in mitochondria functions and cell-cycle checkpoints,
including Chek1, a major component of the DNA damage response. Coordination of
these cellular functions by E4F1 appears essential for the survival of
p53-deficient transformed cells. Acute inactivation of E4F1 in these cells
results in CHK1-dependent checkpoint deficiency and multiple mitochondrial
dysfunctions that lead to increased ROS production, energy stress, and
inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. This deadly cocktail leads to the
accumulation of uncompensated oxidative damage to proteins and extensive DNA
damage, ending in cell death. This supports the rationale of therapeutic
strategies simultaneously targeting mitochondria and CHK1 for selective killing
of p53-deficient cancer cells.

    <title>Pathway Tools version 19.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome
  Informatics and Systems Biology</title>
    <summary>  Pathway Tools is a bioinformatics software environment with a broad set of
capabilities. The software provides genome-informatics tools such as a genome
browser, sequence alignments, a genome-variant analyzer, and
comparative-genomics operations. It offers metabolic-informatics tools, such as
metabolic reconstruction, quantitative metabolic modeling, prediction of
reaction atom mappings, and metabolic route search. Pathway Tools also provides
regulatory-informatics tools, such as the ability to represent and visualize a
wide range of regulatory interactions. The software creates and manages a type
of organism-specific database called a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB), which
the software enables database curators to interactively edit. It supports web
publishing of PGDBs and provides a large number of query, visualization, and
omics-data analysis tools. Scientists around the world have created more than
9,800 PGDBs by using Pathway Tools, many of which are curated databases for
important model organisms. Those PGDBs can be exchanged using a peer-to-peer
database-sharing system called the PGDB Registry.

    <title>Snowball: Strain aware gene assembly of Metagenomes</title>
    <summary>  Gene assembly is an important step in functional analysis of shotgun
metagenomic data. Nonetheless, strain aware assembly remains a challenging
task, as current assembly tools often fail to distinguish among strain variants
or require closely related reference genomes of the studied species to be
available. We have developed Snowball, a novel strain aware and reference-free
gene assembler for shotgun metagenomic data. It uses profile hidden Markov
models (HMMs) of gene domains of interest to guide the assembly. Our assembler
performs gene assembly of individual gene domains based on read overlaps and
error correction using read quality scores at the same time, which result in
very low per-base error rates. The software runs on a user-defined number of
processor cores in parallel, runs on a standard laptop and is freely available
for installation under Linux or OS X on:

    <title>Approaches to link RNA secondary structures with splicing regulation</title>
    <summary>  In higher eukaryotes, alternative splicing is usually regulated by protein
factors, which bind to the pre-mRNA and affect the recognition of splicing
signals. There is recent evidence that the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA
may also play an important role in this process, either by facilitating or by
hindering the interaction with factors and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs) that regulate splicing. Moreover, the secondary structure could play a
fundamental role in the splicing of yeast species, which lack many of the
regulatory splicing factors present in metazoans. This review describes the
steps in the analysis of the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA and its
possible relation to splicing. As a working example, we use the case of yeast
and the problem of the recognition of the 3-prime splice site.

    <title>Analysing multiple types of molecular profiles simultaneously:
  connecting the needles in the haystack</title>
    <summary>  It has been shown that a random-effects framework can be used to test the
association between a gene's expression level and the number of DNA copies of a
set of genes. This gene-set modelling framework was later applied to find
associations between mRNA expression and microRNA expression, by defining the
gene sets using target prediction information.
  Here, we extend the model introduced by Menezes et al (2009) to consider the
effect of not just copy number, but also of other molecular profiles such as
methylation changes and loss-of-heterozigosity (LOH), on gene expression
levels. We will consider again sets of measurements, to improve robustness of
results and increase the power to find associations. Our approach can be used
genome-wide to find associations, yields a test to help separate true
associations from noise and can include confounders.
  We apply our method to colon and to breast cancer samples, for which
genome-wide copy number, methylation and gene expression profiles are
available. Our findings include interesting gene expression-regulating
mechanisms, which may involve only one of copy number or methylation, or both
for the same samples. We even are able to find effects due to different
molecular mechanisms in different samples.
  Our method can equally well be applied to cases where other types of
molecular (high-dimensional) data are collected, such as LOH, SNP genotype and
microRNA expression data. Computationally efficient, it represents a flexible
and powerful tool to study associations between high-dimensional datasets. The
method is freely available via the SIM BioConductor package.

    <title>Keep Me Around: Intron Retention Detection and Analysis</title>
    <summary>  We present a tool, keep me around (kma), a suite of python scripts and an R
package that finds retained introns in RNA-Seq experiments and incorporates
biological replicates to reduce the number of false positives when detecting
retention events. kma uses the results of existing quantification tools that
probabilistically assign multi-mapping reads, thus interfacing easily with
transcript quantification pipelines. The data is represented in a convenient,
database style format that allows for easy aggregation across introns, genes,
samples, and conditions to allow for further exploratory analysis.

    <title>Supporting Regularized Logistic Regression Privately and Efficiently</title>
    <summary>  As one of the most popular statistical and machine learning models, logistic
regression with regularization has found wide adoption in biomedicine, social
sciences, information technology, and so on. These domains often involve data
of human subjects that are contingent upon strict privacy regulations.
Increasing concerns over data privacy make it more and more difficult to
coordinate and conduct large-scale collaborative studies, which typically rely
on cross-institution data sharing and joint analysis. Our work here focuses on
safeguarding regularized logistic regression, a widely-used machine learning
model in various disciplines while at the same time has not been investigated
from a data security and privacy perspective. We consider a common use scenario
of multi-institution collaborative studies, such as in the form of research
consortia or networks as widely seen in genetics, epidemiology, social
sciences, etc. To make our privacy-enhancing solution practical, we demonstrate
a non-conventional and computationally efficient method leveraging distributing
computing and strong cryptography to provide comprehensive protection over
individual-level and summary data. Extensive empirical evaluation on several
studies validated the privacy guarantees, efficiency and scalability of our
proposal. We also discuss the practical implications of our solution for
large-scale studies and applications from various disciplines, including
genetic and biomedical studies, smart grid, network analysis, etc.

    <title>Unexpected links reflect the noise in networks</title>
    <summary>  Gene covariation networks are commonly used to study biological processes.
The inference of gene covariation networks from observational data can be
challenging, especially considering the large number of players involved and
the small number of biological replicates available for analysis. We propose a
new statistical method for estimating the number of erroneous edges in
reconstructed networks that strongly enhances commonly used inference
approaches. This method is based on a special relationship between sign of
correlation (positive/negative) and directionality (up/down) of gene
regulation, and allows for the identification and removal of approximately half
of all erroneous edges. Using the mathematical model of Bayesian networks and
positive correlation inequalities we establish a mathematical foundation for
our method. Analyzing existing biological datasets, we find a strong
correlation between the results of our method and false discovery rate (FDR).
Furthermore, simulation analysis demonstrates that our method provides a more
accurate estimate of network error than FDR.

    <title>Watterson estimators for Next Generation Sequencing: from trios to
  autopolyploids</title>
    <summary>  Several variations of the Watterson estimator of variability for Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have been proposed in the literature. We
present a unified framework for generalized Watterson estimators based on
Maximum Composite Likelihood, which encompasses most of the existing
estimators. We propose this class of unbiased estimators as generalized
Watterson estimators for a large class of NGS data, including pools and trios.
We also discuss the relation with the estimators that have been proposed in the
literature and show that they admit two equivalent but seemingly different
forms, deriving a set of combinatorial identities as a byproduct. Finally, we
give a detailed treatment of Watterson estimators for single or multiple
autopolyploid individuals.

    <title>Entropy-scaling search of massive biological data</title>
    <summary>  Many datasets exhibit a well-defined structure that can be exploited to
design faster search tools, but it is not always clear when such acceleration
is possible. Here, we introduce a framework for similarity search based on
characterizing a dataset's entropy and fractal dimension. We prove that
searching scales in time with metric entropy (number of covering hyperspheres),
if the fractal dimension of the dataset is low, and scales in space with the
sum of metric entropy and information-theoretic entropy (randomness of the
data). Using these ideas, we present accelerated versions of standard tools,
with no loss in specificity and little loss in sensitivity, for use in three
domains---high-throughput drug screening (Ammolite, 150x speedup), metagenomics
(MICA, 3.5x speedup of DIAMOND [3,700x BLASTX]), and protein structure search
(esFragBag, 10x speedup of FragBag). Our framework can be used to achieve
"compressive omics," and the general theory can be readily applied to data
science problems outside of biology.

    <title>Capacity and Expressiveness of Genomic Tandem Duplication</title>
    <summary>  The majority of the human genome consists of repeated sequences. An important
type of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where
identical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence
$AGTC\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from
$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate
the possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \textit{seed},
i.e.\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We
study the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's
generating power. Our results include \textit{exact capacity} values for
certain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role
of DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define
the notion of the \textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the
capability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \textit{completely}
characterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general
alphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated
result by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary
square-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded
tandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication
length, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as
substrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular
interest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we
also show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results
illustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed
in generating a large number of sequences for these systems.

    <title>The Bulk and The Tail of Minimal Absent Words in Genome Sequences</title>
    <summary>  Minimal absent words (MAW) of a genomic sequence are subsequences that are
absent themselves but the subwords of which are all present in the sequence.
The characteristic distribution of genomic MAWs as a function of their length
has been observed to be qualitatively similar for all living organisms, the
bulk being rather short, and only relatively few being long. It has been an
open issue whether the reason behind this phenomenon is statistical or reflects
a biological mechanism, and what biological information is contained in absent
words. In this work we demonstrate that the bulk can be described by a
probabilistic model of sampling words from random sequences, while the tail of
long MAWs is of biological origin. We introduce the novel concept of a core of
a minimal absent word, which are sequences present in the genome and closest to
a given MAW. We show that in bacteria and yeast the cores of the longest MAWs,
which exist in two or more copies, are located in highly conserved regions the
most prominent example being ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We also show that while
the distribution of the cores of long MAWs is roughly uniform over these
genomes on a coarse-grained level, on a more detailed level it is strongly
enhanced in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and, to a lesser extent, also in 5'
UTRs. This indicates that MAWs and associated MAW cores correspond to
fine-tuned evolutionary relationships, and suggest that they can be more widely
used as markers for genomic complexity.

    <title>Detecting Community Structures in Hi-C Genomic Data</title>
    <summary>  Community detection (CD) algorithms are applied to Hi-C data to discover new
communities of loci in the 3D conformation of human and mouse DNA. We find that
CD has some distinct advantages over pre-existing methods: (1) it is capable of
finding a variable number of communities, (2) it can detect communities of DNA
loci either adjacent or distant in the 1D sequence, and (3) it allows us to
obtain a principled value of k, the number of communities present. Forcing k =
2, our method recovers earlier findings of Lieberman-Aiden, et al. (2009), but
letting k be a parameter, our method obtains as optimal value k = 6,
discovering new candidate communities. In addition to discovering large
communities that partition entire chromosomes, we also show that CD can detect
small-scale topologically associating domains (TADs) such as those found in
Dixon, et al. (2012). CD thus provides a natural and flexible statistical
framework for understanding the folding structure of DNA at multiple scales in
Hi-C data.

    <title>Life without dUTPase</title>
    <summary>  Fine-tuned regulation of the cellular nucleotide pools is indispensable for
faithful replication of DNA. The genetic information is also safeguarded by DNA
damage recognition and repair processes. Uracil is one of the most frequently
occurring erroneous base in DNA; it can arise from cytosine deamination or
thymine-replacing incorporation. Two enzyme families are primarily involved in
keeping DNA uracil-free: dUTPases that prevent thymine-replacing incorporation
and uracil-DNA glycosylases that excise uracil from DNA and initiate
uracil-excision repair. Both dUTPase and the most efficient uracil-DNA
glycosylase UNG is thought to be ubiquitous in free-living organisms. In the
present work, we have systematically investigated the genotype of deposited
fully sequenced bacterial and Archaeal genomes. Surprisingly, we have found
that in contrast to the generally held opinion, a wide number of bacterial and
Archaeal species lack the dUTPase gene(s). The dut- genotype is present in
diverse bacterial phyla indicating that loss of this (or these) gene(s) has
occurred multiple times during evolution. We have identified several survival
strategies in lack of dUTPases: i) simultaneous lack or inhibition of UNG, ii)
acquisition of a less dUTP-specific sanitizing nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and
iii) supply of dUTPase from bacteriophages. Our data indicate that several
unicellular microorganisms may efficiently cope with a dut- genotype
potentially leading to an unusual uracil-enrichment in their genomic DNA.

    <title>Chromosomal rearrangements as barriers to genetic homogenization between
  archaic and modern humans</title>
    <summary>  Chromosomal rearrangements, which shuffle DNA throughout the genome, are an
important source of divergence across taxa. Using a paired-end read approach
with Illumina sequence data for archaic humans, I identify changes in genome
structure that occurred recently in human evolution. Hundreds of rearrangements
indicate genomic trafficking between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, raising
the possibility of sex-specific changes. Additionally, genes adjacent to genome
structure changes in Neanderthals are associated with testis-specific
expression, consistent with evolutionary theory that new genes commonly form
with expression in the testes. I identify one case of new-gene creation through
transposition from the Y chromosome to chromosome 10 that combines the 5' end
of the testis-specific gene Fank1 with previously untranscribed sequence. This
new transcript experienced copy number expansion in archaic genomes, indicating
rapid genomic change. Among rearrangements identified in Neanderthals, 13% are
transposition of selfish genetic elements, while 32% appear to be ectopic
exchange between repeats. In Denisovan, the pattern is similar but numbers are
significantly higher with 18% of rearrangements reflecting transposition and
40% ectopic exchange between distantly related repeats. There is an excess of
divergent rearrangements relative to polymorphism in Denisovan, which might
result from non-uniform rates of mutation, possibly reflecting a burst of TE
activity in the lineage that led to Denisovan. Finally, loci containing genome
structure changes show diminished rates of introgression from Neanderthals into
modern humans, consistent with the hypothesis that rearrangements serve as
barriers to gene flow during hybridization. Together, these results suggest
that this previously unidentified source of genomic variation has important
biological consequences in human evolution.

    <title>A Bayesian feature allocation model for tumor heterogeneity</title>
    <summary>  We develop a feature allocation model for inference on genetic tumor
variation using next-generation sequencing data. Specifically, we record single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) based on short reads mapped to human reference
genome and characterize tumor heterogeneity by latent haplotypes defined as a
scaffold of SNVs on the same homologous genome. For multiple samples from a
single tumor, assuming that each sample is composed of some sample-specific
proportions of these haplotypes, we then fit the observed variant allele
fractions of SNVs for each sample and estimate the proportions of haplotypes.
Varying proportions of haplotypes across samples is evidence of tumor
heterogeneity since it implies varying composition of cell subpopulations.
Taking a Bayesian perspective, we proceed with a prior probability model for
all relevant unknown quantities, including, in particular, a prior probability
model on the binary indicators that characterize the latent haplotypes. Such
prior models are known as feature allocation models. Specifically, we define a
simplified version of the Indian buffet process, one of the most traditional
feature allocation models. The proposed model allows overlapping clustering of
SNVs in defining latent haplotypes, which reflects the evolutionary process of
subclonal expansion in tumor samples.

    <title>Bipartite Community Structure of eQTLs</title>
    <summary>  Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and eQTL analyses have produced a
large and growing number of genetic associations linked to a wide range of
human phenotypes. As of 2013, there were more than 11,000 SNPs associated with
a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the
functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an
approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place
SNPs into a functional context.
  Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a
study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL
associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR $&lt;
0.1$) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the
highly-connected "hub" SNPs within the network were devoid of
disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly
modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of
genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct
biological functions (P $ &lt; 5 \times 10^{-4}$) including COPD-related
functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the
cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations
for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to
our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups
of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related
genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those
functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can
be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other
phenotypic traits.

    <summary>  The birth of new genes is an important motor of evolutionary innovation.
Whereas many new genes arise by gene duplication, others originate at genomic
regions that do not contain any gene or gene copy. Some of these newly
expressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by
natural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and
underlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a
comprehensive view of this process we have performed in-depth sequencing of the
transcriptomes of four mammalian species, human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse,
and subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding
syntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five
thousand new transcriptional multiexonic events in human and/or chimpanzee that
are not observed in the rest of species. By comparative genomics we show that
the expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory
motifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites
downstream of the TSS. We also find that the coding potential of the new genes
is higher than expected by chance, consistent with the presence of
protein-coding genes in the dataset. Using available human tissue proteomics
and ribosome profiling data we identify several de novo genes with translation
evidence. These genes show significant purifying selection signatures,
indicating that they are probably functional. Taken together, the data supports
a model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome
provide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins.

    <title>Nucleosome positioning: resources and tools online</title>
    <summary>  Nucleosome positioning is an important process required for proper genome
packing and its accessibility to execute the genetic program in a
cell-specific, timely manner. In the recent years hundreds of papers have been
devoted to the bioinformatics, physics and biology of nucleosome positioning.
The purpose of this review is to cover a practical aspect of this field, namely
to provide a guide to the multitude of nucleosome positioning resources
available online. These include almost 300 experimental datasets of genome-wide
nucleosome occupancy profiles determined in different cell types and more than
40 computational tools for the analysis of experimental nucleosome positioning
data and prediction of intrinsic nucleosome formation probabilities from the
DNA sequence. A manually curated, up to date list of these resources will be
maintained at http://generegulation.info.

    <title>Population genomics of intrapatient HIV-1 evolution</title>
    <summary>  Many microbial populations rapidly adapt to changing environments with
multiple variants competing for survival. To quantify such complex evolutionary
dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants
are essential. We performed whole-genome deep sequencing of HIV-1 populations
in 9 untreated patients, with 6-12 longitudinal samples per patient spanning
5-8 years of infection. We show that patterns of minor diversity are
reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a
universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards
the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for
almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on
conservation. Frequent recombination limits linkage disequilibrium to about
100bp in most of the genome, but strong hitch-hiking due to short range linkage
limits diversity.

    <title>Representing and decomposing genomic structural variants as balanced
  integer flows on sequence graphs</title>
    <summary>  The study of genomic variation has provided key insights into the functional
role of mutations. Predominantly, studies have focused on single nucleotide
variants (SNV), which are relatively easy to detect and can be described with
rich mathematical models. However, it has been observed that genomes are highly
plastic, and that whole regions can be moved, removed or duplicated in bulk.
These structural variants (SV) have been shown to have significant impact on
the phenotype, but their study has been held back by the combinatorial
complexity of the underlying models. We describe here a general model of
structural variation that encompasses both balanced rearrangements and
arbitrary copy-numbers variants (CNV). In this model, we show that the space of
possible evolutionary histories that explain the structural differences between
any two genomes can be sampled ergodically.

    <title>Combining exome and gene expression datasets in one graphical model of
  disease to empower the discovery of disease mechanisms</title>
    <summary>  Identifying genes associated with complex human diseases is one of the main
challenges of human genetics and computational medicine. To answer this
question, millions of genetic variants get screened to identify a few of
importance. To increase the power of identifying genes associated with diseases
and to account for other potential sources of protein function aberrations, we
propose a novel factor-graph based model, where much of the biological
knowledge is incorporated through factors and priors. Our extensive simulations
show that our method has superior sensitivity and precision compared to
variant-aggregating and differential expression methods. Our integrative
approach was able to identify important genes in breast cancer, identifying
genes that had coding aberrations in some patients and regulatory abnormalities
in others, emphasizing the importance of data integration to explain the
disease in a larger number of patients.

    <title>Estimating Reproducibility in Genome-Wide Association Studies</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to discover genetic
variants associated with diseases. To control false positives, all findings
from GWAS need to be verified with additional evidences, even for associations
discovered from a high power study. Replication study is a common verification
method by using independent samples. An association is regarded as true
positive with a high confidence when it can be identified in both primary study
and replication study. Currently, there is no systematic study on the behavior
of positives in the replication study when the positive results of primary
study are considered as the prior information.
  In this paper, two probabilistic measures named Reproducibility Rate (RR) and
False Irreproducibility Rate (FIR) are proposed to quantitatively describe the
behavior of primary positive associations (i.e. positive associations
identified in the primary study) in the replication study. RR is a conditional
probability measuring how likely a primary positive association will also be
positive in the replication study. This can be used to guide the design of
replication study, and to check the consistency between the results of primary
study and those of replication study. FIR, on the contrary, measures how likely
a primary positive association may still be a true positive even when it is
negative in the replication study. This can be used to generate a list of
potentially true associations in the irreproducible findings for further
scrutiny. The estimation methods of these two measures are given. Simulation
results and real experiments show that our estimation methods have high
accuracy and good prediction performance.

    <title>The mysterious orphans of Mycoplasmataceae</title>
    <summary>  Background: The length of a protein sequence is largely determined by its
function, i.e. each functional group is associated with an optimal size.
However, comparative genomics revealed that proteins length may be affected by
additional factors. In 2002 it was shown that in bacterium Escherichia coli and
the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences with no homologs are, on
average, shorter than those with homologs. Most experts now agree that the
length distributions are distinctly different between protein sequences with
and without homologs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. In this study, we
examine this postulate by a comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic
genomes and focusing on certain exceptions.
  Results: We compared lengths distributions of having homologs proteins (HHPs)
and non-having homologs proteins (orphans or ORFans) in all currently annotated
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As expected, the HHPs and ORFans have
strikingly different length distributions in almost all genomes. As previously
established, the HHPs, indeed, are, on average, longer than the ORFans, and the
length distributions for the ORFans have a relatively narrow peak, in contrast
to the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a wider range of values. However, about
thirty genomes do not obey these rules. Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma
and Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans distributions, with the mean lengths of
ORFan larger than the mean lengths of HHPs. These genera constitute over 80% of
atypical genomes.
  Conclusions: We confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes the previous
observation that HHPs and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We
also showed that Mycoplasmataceae genomes have distinctive distributions of
ORFans lengths. We offer several possible biological explanations of this
phenomenon.

    <title>Alignment of protein-coding sequences with frameshift extension
  penalties</title>
    <summary>  We introduce an algorithm for the alignment of protein- coding sequences
accounting for frameshifts. The main specificity of this algorithm as compared
to previously published protein-coding sequence alignment methods is the
introduction of a penalty cost for frameshift ex- tensions. Previous algorithms
have only used constant frameshift penal- ties. This is similar to the use of
scoring schemes with affine gap penalties in classical sequence alignment
algorithms. However, the overall penalty of a frameshift portion in an
alignment cannot be formulated as an affine function, because it should also
incorporate varying codon substitution scores. The second specificity of the
algorithm is its search space being the set of all possible alignments between
two coding sequences, under the classical definition of an alignment between
two DNA sequences. Previous algorithms have introduced constraints on the
length of the alignments, and additional symbols for the representation of
frameshift openings in an alignment. The algorithm has the same asymptotic
space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

    <title>Biases in differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data: A matter of
  replicate type</title>
    <summary>  In differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-seq count data, it is known
that genes with a larger read number are more likely to be differentially
expressed. This bias has a profound effect on the subsequent Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis by perturbing the ranks of gene-sets. Another known bias is that the
commonly used parametric DE analysis methods (e.g., edgeR, DESeq and baySeq)
tend to yield more DE genes as the sequencing depth is increased. We
nevertheless show that these biases are in fact confined to data of the
technical replicate type. We also show the GO or gene-set enrichment analysis
methods applied to technical replicate data result in considerable number of
false positives. In conclusion, the current DE and enrichment analysis methods
can be confidently used for biological replicate count data, while caution
should be exercised when analysing technical replicate data.

    <title>Bayesian hierarchical modelling for inferring genetic interactions in
  yeast</title>
    <summary>  Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) is a high-throughput experimental and
computational methodology for measuring the growth of microbial populations.
QFA screens can be used to compare the health of cell populations with and
without a mutation in a query gene in order to infer genetic interaction
strengths genome-wide, examining thousands of separate genotypes. We introduce
Bayesian, hierarchical models of population growth rates and genetic
interactions that better reflect QFA experimental design than current
approaches. Our new approach models population dynamics and genetic interaction
simultaneously, thereby avoiding passing information between models via a
univariate fitness summary. Matching experimental structure more closely,
Bayesian hierarchical approaches use data more efficiently and find new
evidence for genes which interact with yeast telomeres within a published
dataset.

    <title>Codon Context Optimization in Synthetic Gene Design</title>
    <summary>  Advances in de novo synthesis of DNA and computational gene design methods
make possible the customization of genes by direct manipulation of features
such as codon bias and mRNA secondary structure. Codon context is another
feature significantly affecting mRNA translational efficiency, but existing
methods and tools for evaluating and designing novel optimized protein coding
sequences utilize untested heuristics and do not provide quantifiable
guarantees on design quality. In this study we examine statistical properties
of codon context measures in an effort to better understand the phenomenon. We
analyze the computational complexity of codon context optimization and design
exact and efficient heuristic gene recoding algorithms under reasonable
constraint models. We also present a web-based tool for evaluating codon
context bias in the appropriate context.

    <title>A Model for Competition for Ribosomes in the Cell</title>
    <summary>  Large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and the resulting competition for
the available ribosomes has important implications to the cell's functioning
and evolution. Developing a better understanding of the intricate correlations
between these simultaneous processes, rather than focusing on the translation
of a single isolated transcript, should help in gaining a better understanding
of mRNA translation regulation and the way elongation rates affect organismal
fitness. A model of simultaneous translation is specifically important when
dealing with highly expressed genes, as these consume more resources. In
addition, such a model can lead to more accurate predictions that are needed in
the interconnection of translational modules in synthetic biology. We develop
and analyze a general model for large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and
competition for ribosomes. This is based on combining several ribosome flow
models (RFMs) interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes. We prove that the
compound system always converges to a steady-state and that it always entrains
or phase locks to periodically time-varying transition rates in any of the mRNA
molecules. We use this model to explore the interactions between the various
mRNA molecules and ribosomes at steady-state. We show that increasing the
length of an mRNA molecule decreases the production rate of all the mRNAs.
Increasing any of the codon translation rates in a specific mRNA molecule
yields a local effect: an increase in the translation rate of this mRNA, and
also a global effect: the translation rates in the other mRNA molecules all
increase or all decrease. These results suggest that the effect of codon
decoding rates of endogenous and heterologous mRNAs on protein production is
more complicated than previously thought.

    <title>SCARs: endogenous human stem cell-associated retroviruses and
  therapy-resistant malignant tumors</title>
    <summary>  Discoveries of endogenous human stem cell-associated retroviruses (SCARs)
revealed consistent activation of specific endogenous retroviral elements in
human preimplantation embryos and documented the essential role of the
sustained retroviral activities in the maintenance of pluripotency, functional
identity and integrity of naive-state embryonic stem cells, and anti-viral
resistance of the early-stage human embryos. Activation of specific SCARs,
namely LTR7.HERVH and LTR5Hs.HERVK, has been demonstrated in patients diagnosed
with multiple types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders
and it is likely associated with the emergence of clinically lethal therapy
resistant death-from-cancer phenotypes in a sub-set of cancer patients
diagnosed with different types of malignant tumors.

    <title>Will solid-state drives accelerate your bioinformatics? In-depth
  profiling, performance analysis, and beyond</title>
    <summary>  A wide variety of large-scale data has been produced in bioinformatics. In
response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been
partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many
bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses due
to factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new
generations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based
solid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data
processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can
accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement
of hard disk drives (HDDs) by SSDs results in dramatic speedup. Despite the
various advantages and continuous cost reduction of SSDs, there has been little
review of SSD-based profiling and performance exploration of important but
time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform
in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using
multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research,
we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics
algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit SSDs. The programs we profile cover
traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly,
mapping, expression analysis, variant calling, and metagenomics. We explain how
acceleration by parallelization can be combined with SSDs for improved
performance and also how using SSDs can expedite important bioinformatics
pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and
transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We hope that this review
can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics
algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful
storage devices.

    <title>No evidence of histology subtype-specific prognostic signatures among
  lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients at early stages</title>
    <summary>  Background
  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant histological type of
lung cancer, accounting for up to 85% of cases. Disease stage is commonly used
to determine adjuvant treatment eligibility of NSCLC patients, however, it is
an imprecise predictor of the prognosis of an individual patient. Currently,
many researchers resort to microarray technology for identifying relevant
genetic prognostic markers, with particular attention on trimming or extending
a Cox regression model.
  Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are two
major histology subtypes. It has been demonstrated that there exist fundamental
differences in the underlying mechanisms between them, which motivated us to
postulate there might exist specific genes relevant to prognosis of each
histology subtype.
  Results
  In this article, we propose a simple filterer feature selection algorithm
with a Cox regression model as the base. Applying this method to a real-world
microarray data, no evidence has been found to support the existence of
histology-specific prognostic gene signature. Nevertheless, a 31-gene
prognostic gene signature for the early-stage AC and SCC samples is obtained,
which provides comparable performance when compared with other relevant
signatures.
  Conclusions
  Our proposal is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement.
Therefore, it is expected that other researchers, especially those with less
statistical knowledge and experience, can adapt this method readily to test
their own research hypotheses.

    <title>Pathway-based feature selection algorithms identify genes discriminating
  patients with multiple sclerosis apart from controls</title>
    <summary>  Introduction The focus of analyzing data from microarray experiments and
extracting biological insight from such data has experienced a shift from
identification of individual genes in association with a phenotype to that of
biological pathways or gene sets. Meanwhile, feature selection algorithm
becomes imperative to cope with the high dimensional nature of many modeling
tasks in bioinformatics. Many feature selection algorithms use information
contained within a gene set as a biological priori, and select relevant
features by incorporating such information. Thus, an integration of gene set
analysis with feature selection is highly desired. Significance analysis of
microarray to gene-set reduction analysis (SAM-GSR) algorithm is a novel
direction of gene set analysis, aiming at further reduction of gene set into a
core subset. Here, we explore the feature selection trait possessed by SAM-GSR
and then modify SAM-GSR specifically to better fulfill this role. Results and
Conclusions Training on a multiple sclerosis (MS) microarray data using both
SAM-GSR and our modification of SAM-GSR, excellent discriminative performance
on an independent test set was achieved. To conclude, absorbing biological
information from a gene set may be helpful for classification and feature
selection. Discussion Given the fact the complete pathway information is far
from completeness, a statistical method capable of constructing biologically
meaningful gene networks is in demand. The basic requirement is that interplay
among genes must be taken into account.

    <title>Binding of transcription factors adapts to resolve information-energy
  trade-off</title>
    <summary>  We examine the binding of transcription factors to DNA in terms of an
information transfer problem. The input of the noisy channel is the biophysical
signal of a factor bound to a DNA site, and the output is a distribution of
probable DNA sequences at this site. This task involves an inherent tradeoff
between the information gain and the energetics of the binding interaction -
high binding energies provide higher information gain but hinder the dynamics
of the system as factors are bound too tightly. We show that adaptation of the
binding interaction towards increasing information transfer under a general
energy constraint implies that the information gain per specific binding energy
at each base-pair is maximized. We analyze hundreds of prokaryote and eukaryote
transcription factors from various organisms to evaluate the discrimination
energies. We find that, in accordance with our theoretical argument, binding
energies nearly maximize the information gain per energy. This work suggests
the adaptation of information gain as a generic design principle of molecular
recognition systems.

    <title>End-to-End Optimization of High Throughput DNA Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  At the core of high throughput DNA sequencing platforms lies a bio-physical
surface process that results in a random geometry of clusters of homogenous
short DNA fragments typically hundreds of base pairs long - bridge
amplification. The statistical properties of this random process and length of
the fragments are critical as they affect the information that can be
subsequently extracted, i.e., density of successfully inferred DNA fragment
reads. The ensemble of overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to
computationally reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence, e.g,
ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of base pairs. The success of
the reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble of
DNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this paper using stochastic
geometry we model and optimize the end-to-end process linking and partially
controlling the statistics of the physical processes to the success of the
computational step. This provides, for the first time, a framework capturing
salient features of such sequencing platforms that can be used to study cost,
performance or sensitivity of the sequencing process.

    <title>Evolutionary Algorithms: Concepts, Designs, and Applications in
  Bioinformatics: Evolutionary Algorithms for Bioinformatics</title>
    <summary>  Since genetic algorithm was proposed by John Holland (Holland J. H., 1975) in
the early 1970s, the study of evolutionary algorithm has emerged as a popular
research field (Civicioglu &amp; Besdok, 2013). Researchers from various scientific
and engineering disciplines have been digging into this field, exploring the
unique power of evolutionary algorithms (Hadka &amp; Reed, 2013). Many applications
have been successfully proposed in the past twenty years. For example,
mechanical design (Lampinen &amp; Zelinka, 1999), electromagnetic optimization
(Rahmat-Samii &amp; Michielssen, 1999), environmental protection (Bertini, Felice,
Moretti, &amp; Pizzuti, 2010), finance (Larkin &amp; Ryan, 2010), musical orchestration
(Esling, Carpentier, &amp; Agon, 2010), pipe routing (Furuholmen, Glette, Hovin, &amp;
Torresen, 2010), and nuclear reactor core design (Sacco, Henderson,
Rios-Coelho, Ali, &amp; Pereira, 2009). In particular, its function optimization
capability was highlighted (Goldberg &amp; Richardson, 1987) because of its high
adaptability to different function landscapes, to which we cannot apply
traditional optimization techniques (Wong, Leung, &amp; Wong, 2009). Here we review
the applications of evolutionary algorithms in bioinformatics.

    <title>Unsupervised Learning in Genome Informatics</title>
    <summary>  With different genomes available, unsupervised learning algorithms are
essential in learning genome-wide biological insights. Especially, the
functional characterization of different genomes is essential for us to
understand lives. In this book chapter, we review the state-of-the-art
unsupervised learning algorithms for genome informatics from DNA to MicroRNA.
  DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) is the basic component of genomes. A significant
fraction of DNA regions (transcription factor binding sites) are bound by
proteins (transcription factors) to regulate gene expression at different
development stages in different tissues. To fully understand genetics, it is
necessary of us to apply unsupervised learning algorithms to learn and infer
those DNA regions. Here we review several unsupervised learning methods for
deciphering the genome-wide patterns of those DNA regions.
  MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of small endogenous non-coding RNA (RiboNucleic
acid) species, regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by forming
imperfect base-pair with the target sites primarily at the 3$'$ untranslated
regions of the messenger RNAs. Since the 1993 discovery of the first miRNA
\emph{let-7} in worms, a vast amount of studies have been dedicated to
functionally characterizing the functional impacts of miRNA in a network
context to understand complex diseases such as cancer. Here we review several
representative unsupervised learning frameworks on inferring miRNA regulatory
network by exploiting the static sequence-based information pertinent to the
prior knowledge of miRNA targeting and the dynamic information of miRNA
activities implicated by the recently available large data compendia, which
interrogate genome-wide expression profiles of miRNAs and/or mRNAs across
various cell conditions.

    <title>Automatic learning of pre-miRNAs from different species</title>
    <summary>  Discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) relies on predictive models for
characteristic features from miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The short length of
miRNA genes and the lack of pronounced sequence features complicate this task.
To accommodate the peculiarities of plant and animal miRNAs systems, tools for
both systems have evolved differently. However, these tools are biased towards
the species for which they were primarily developed and, consequently, their
predictive performance on data sets from other species of the same kingdom
might be lower. While these biases are intrinsic to the species, the
characterization of their occurrence can lead to computational approaches able
to diminish their negative effect on the accuracy of pre-miRNAs predictive
models. Here, we investigate in this study how 45 predictive models induced for
data sets from 45 species, distributed in eight subphyla, perform when applied
to a species different from the species used in its induction. Our
computational experiments show that the separability of pre-miRNAs and pseudo
pre-miRNAs instances is species-dependent and no feature set performs well for
all species, even within the same subphylum. Mitigating this species
dependency, we show that an ensemble of classifiers reduced the classification
errors for all 45 species. As the ensemble members were obtained using
meaningful, and yet computationally viable feature sets, the ensembles also
have a lower computational cost than individual classifiers that rely on energy
stability parameters, which are of prohibitive computational cost in large
scale applications. In this study, the combination of multiple pre-miRNAs
feature sets and multiple learning biases enhanced the predictive accuracy of
pre-miRNAs classifiers of 45 species. This is certainly a promising approach to
be incorporated in miRNA discovery tools towards more accurate and less
species-dependent tools.

    <title>Methods to study splicing from high-throughput RNA Sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  The development of novel high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods for RNA
(RNA-Seq) has provided a very powerful mean to study splicing under multiple
conditions at unprecedented depth. However, the complexity of the information
to be analyzed has turned this into a challenging task. In the last few years,
a plethora of tools have been developed, allowing researchers to process
RNA-Seq data to study the expression of isoforms and splicing events, and their
relative changes under different conditions. We provide an overview of the
methods available to study splicing from short RNA-Seq data. We group the
methods according to the different questions they address: 1) Assignment of the
sequencing reads to their likely gene of origin. This is addressed by methods
that map reads to the genome and/or to the available gene annotations. 2)
Recovering the sequence of splicing events and isoforms. This is addressed by
transcript reconstruction and de novo assembly methods. 3) Quantification of
events and isoforms. Either after reconstructing transcripts or using an
annotation, many methods estimate the expression level or the relative usage of
isoforms and/or events. 4) Providing an isoform or event view of differential
splicing or expression. These include methods that compare relative
event/isoform abundance or isoform expression across two or more conditions. 5)
Visualizing splicing regulation. Various tools facilitate the visualization of
the RNA-Seq data in the context of alternative splicing. In this review, we do
not describe the specific mathematical models behind each method. Our aim is
rather to provide an overview that could serve as an entry point for users who
need to decide on a suitable tool for a specific analysis. We also attempt to
propose a classification of the tools according to the operations they do, to
facilitate the comparison and choice of methods.

    <title>Codon Bias Patterns of $E.coli$'s Interacting Proteins</title>
    <summary>  Synonymous codons, i.e., DNA nucleotide triplets coding for the same amino
acid, are used differently across the variety of living organisms. The
biological meaning of this phenomenon, known as codon usage bias, is still
controversial. In order to shed light on this point, we propose a new codon
bias index, $CompAI$, that is based on the competition between cognate and
near-cognate tRNAs during translation, without being tuned to the usage bias of
highly expressed genes. We perform a genome-wide evaluation of codon bias for
$E.coli$, comparing $CompAI$ with other widely used indices: $tAI$, $CAI$, and
$Nc$. We show that $CompAI$ and $tAI$ capture similar information by being
positively correlated with gene conservation, measured by ERI, and
essentiality, whereas, $CAI$ and $Nc$ appear to be less sensitive to
evolutionary-functional parameters. Notably, the rate of variation of $tAI$ and
$CompAI$ with ERI allows to obtain sets of genes that consistently belong to
specific clusters of orthologous genes (COGs). We also investigate the
correlation of codon bias at the genomic level with the network features of
protein-protein interactions in $E.coli$. We find that the most densely
connected communities of the network share a similar level of codon bias (as
measured by $CompAI$ and $tAI$). Conversely, a small difference in codon bias
between two genes is, statistically, a prerequisite for the corresponding
proteins to interact. Importantly, among all codon bias indices, $CompAI$ turns
out to have the most coherent distribution over the communities of the
interactome, pointing to the significance of competition among cognate and
near-cognate tRNAs for explaining codon usage adaptation.

    <title>A New Local Score Based Method Applied to Behavior-divergent Quail Lines
  Sequenced in Pools Precisely Detects Selection Signatures on Genes Related to
  Autism</title>
    <summary>  Detecting genomic footprints of selection is an important step in the
understanding of evolution. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome
scans allows increasing the detection power, but haplotype-based methods
require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples.
We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage
disequilibrium, accumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over
a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal, avoiding windowing
methods. This method provided results similar to haplotype-based methods on two
benchmark data sets with individual genotypes. Results obtained for a divergent
selection experiment on behavior in quail, where two lines were sequenced in
pools, are precise and biologically coherent, while competing methods failed:
our approach led to the detection of signals involving genes known to act on
social responsiveness or autistic traits. This local score approach is general
and can be applied to other genome-wide analyzes such as GWAS or genome scans
for selection.

    <title>GMOL: An Interactive Tool for 3D Genome Structure Visualization</title>
    <summary>  It has been shown that genome spatial structures largely affect both genome
activity and DNA function. Knowing this, many researchers are currently
attempting to accurately model genome structures. Despite these increased
efforts there still exists a shortage of tools dedicated to visualizing the
genome. Creating a tool that can accurately visualize the genome can aid
researchers by highlighting structural relationships that may not be obvious
when examining the sequence information alone. Here we present a desktop
application, known as GMOL, designed to effectively visualize genome tertiary
structures at multiple scales so that researchers may better analyze their
genomic data. GMOL was developed based upon our multi-scale approach that
allows a user to zoom in and out between six separate levels within the genome.
These six scales are full genome, chromosome, loci, fiber, nucleosome, and
nucleotide. In order to store the data of the different scales, a new file
format, known as GSS, was created. With GMOL, a user can choose any unit at any
scale and scale it up or down to visualize its structure and retrieve
corresponding genome sequences from either Ensembl or a local database. Users
can also interactively manipulate and measure the whole genome structure and
extract static images and machine-readable data files in PDB format from the
multi-scale structure. By using GMOL researchers will be able to better
understand and analyze genome structure models and the impact their structural
relations have on genome activity and DNA function through GMOLs unique
features and functions, which includes the multi-scale method that can satisfy
the users requirement to not only visualize genome tertiary structure, but also
measure it.

    <title>Towards Better Understanding of Artifacts in Variant Calling from
  High-Coverage Samples</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Whole-genome high-coverage sequencing has been widely used for
personal and cancer genomics as well as in various research areas. However, in
the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of
variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given
the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods.
  Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five
variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a
similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid
genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and
the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major
sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas.
We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in
10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb
without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

    <title>Gene expression modelling across multiple cell-lines with MapReduce</title>
    <summary>  With the wealth of high-throughput sequencing data generated by recent
large-scale consortia, predictive gene expression modelling has become an
important tool for integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic data.
However, sequencing data-sets are characteristically large, and previously
modelling frameworks are typically inefficient and unable to leverage
multi-core or distributed processing architectures. In this study, we detail an
efficient and parallelised MapReduce implementation of gene expression
modelling. We leverage the computational efficiency of this framework to
provide an integrative analysis of over fifty histone modification data-sets
across a variety of cancerous and non-cancerous cell-lines. Our results
demonstrate that the genome-wide relationships between histone modifications
and mRNA transcription are lineage, tissue and karyotype-invariant, and that
models trained on matched epigenetic/transcriptomic data from non-cancerous
cell-lines are able to predict cancerous expression with equivalent genome-wide
fidelity.

    <title>Rapidly evolving in humans topologically associating domains</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide proximity placement analysis of 10,598 HSGRL within the context
of the principal regulatory structures of the interphase chromatin, namely
topologically-associating domains (TADs) and specific sub-TAD structures termed
super-enhancer domains (SEDs) revealed that 0.8%-10.3% of TADs contain more
than half of HSGRL. Of the 3,127 TADs in the hESC genome, 24 (0.8%); 53 (1.7%);
259 (8.3%); and 322 (10.3%) harbor 1,110 (52.4%); 1,936 (50.9%); 1,151 (59.6%);
and 1,601 (58.3%) HSGRL sequences from four distinct families, respectively.
TADs that are enriched for HSGRL and termed rapidly-evolving in humans TADs
(revTADs) manifest distinct correlation patterns between HSGRL placements and
recombination rates. There are significant enrichment within revTAD boundaries
of hESC-enhancers, primate-specific CTCF-binding sites, human-specific
RNAPII-binding sites, hCONDELs, and H3K4me3 peaks with human-specific
enrichment at TSS in prefrontal cortex neurons (p &lt; 0.0001 in all instances).
In hESC genome, 331 of 504 (66%) of SE-harboring TADs contain HSGRL and 68% of
SEs co-localize with HSGRL, suggesting that HSGRL rewired SE-driven GRNs within
revTADs by inserting novel and/or erasing existing regulatory sequences.
Consequently, markedly distinct features of chromatin structures evolved in
hESC compared to mouse: the SE quantity is 3-fold higher and the median SE size
is significantly larger; concomitantly, the TAD number is increased by 42%
while the median TAD size is decreased (p=9.11E-37). Present analyses revealed
a global role for HSGRL in increasing both quantity and size of SEs and
increasing the number and size reduction of TADs, which may facilitate a
convergence of TAD and SED architectures of interphase chromatin and define a
trend of increasing regulatory complexity during evolution of GRNs.

    <title>Determination of Nonlinear Genetic Architecture using Compressed Sensing</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a statistical method that can reconstruct nonlinear genetic
models (i.e., including epistasis, or gene-gene interactions) from
phenotype-genotype (GWAS) data. The computational and data resource
requirements are similar to those necessary for reconstruction of linear
genetic models (or identification of gene-trait associations), assuming a
condition of generalized sparsity, which limits the total number of gene-gene
interactions. An example of a sparse nonlinear model is one in which a typical
locus interacts with several or even many others, but only a small subset of
all possible interactions exist. It seems plausible that most genetic
architectures fall in this category. Our method uses a generalization of
compressed sensing (L1-penalized regression) applied to nonlinear functions of
the sensing matrix. We give theoretical arguments suggesting that the method is
nearly optimal in performance, and demonstrate its effectiveness on broad
classes of nonlinear genetic models using both real and simulated human
genomes.

    <title>Genome-wide modelling of transcription kinetics reveals patterns of RNA
  production delays</title>
    <summary>  Genes with similar transcriptional activation kinetics can display very
different temporal mRNA profiles due to differences in transcription time,
degradation rate and RNA processing kinetics. Recent studies have shown that a
splicing-associated RNA production delay can be significant. We introduce a
joint model of transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation which can be
used for inference of transcription rate, RNA production delay and degradation
rate given genome-wide data from high-throughput sequencing time course
experiments. We combine a mechanistic differential equation model with a
non-parametric statistical modelling approach allowing us to capture a broad
range of activation kinetics, and use Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify
the uncertainty in the estimates of the kinetic parameters. We apply the model
to data from estrogen receptor (ER-{\alpha}) activation in the MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line. We use RNA polymerase II (pol-II) ChIP-Seq time course data
to characterise transcriptional activation and mRNA-Seq time course data to
quantify mature transcripts. We find that 11% of genes with a good signal in
the data display a delay of more than 20 minutes between completing
transcription and mature mRNA production. The genes displaying these long
delays are significantly more likely to be short. We also find a statistical
association between high delay and late intron retention in pre-mRNA data,
indicating significant splicing-associated production delays in many genes.

    <title>Genome-scale phylogenetic analysis finds extensive gene transfer among
  Fungi</title>
    <summary>  Although the role of lateral gene transfer is well recognized in the
evolution of bacteria, it is generally assumed that it has had less influence
among eukaryotes. To explore this hypothesis we compare the dynamics of genome
evolution in two groups of organisms: Cyanobacteria and Fungi. Ancestral
genomes are inferred in both clades using two types of methods. First, Count, a
gene tree unaware method that models gene duplications, gains and losses to
explain the observed numbers of genes present in a genome. Second, ALE, a more
recent gene tree-aware method that reconciles gene trees with a species tree
using a model of gene duplication, loss, and transfer. We compare their merits
and their ability to quantify the role of transfers, and assess the impact of
taxonomic sampling on their inferences. We present what we believe is
compelling evidence that gene transfer plays a significant role in the
evolution of Fungi.

    <title>Recombinant transfer in the basic genome of E. coli</title>
    <summary>  An approximation to the ~4 Mbp basic genome shared by 32 strains of E. coli
representing six evolutionary groups has been derived and analyzed
computationally. A multiple-alignment of the 32 complete genome sequences was
filtered to remove mobile elements and identify the most reliable ~90% of the
aligned length of each of the resulting 496 basic-genome pairs. Patterns of
single-bp mutations (SNPs) in aligned pairs distinguish clonally inherited
regions from regions where either genome has acquired DNA fragments from
diverged genomes by homologous recombination since their last common ancestor.
Such recombinant transfer is pervasive across the basic genome, mostly between
genomes in the same evolutionary group, and generates many unique mosaic
patterns. The six least-diverged genome-pairs have one or two recombinant
transfers of length ~40-115 kbp (and few if any other transfers), each
containing one or more gene clusters known to confer strong selective advantage
in some environments. Moderately diverged genome-pairs (0.4-1% SNPs ) show
mosaic patterns of interspersed clonal and recombinant regions of varying
lengths throughout the basic genome, whereas more highly diverged pairs within
an evolutionary group or pairs between evolutionary groups having &gt;1.3% SNPs
have few clonal matches longer than a few kbp. Many recombinant transfers
appear to incorporate fragments of the entering DNA produced by restriction
systems of the recipient cell. A simple computational model can closely fit the
data. Most recombinant transfers seem likely to be due to generalized
transduction by co-evolving populations of phages, which could efficiently
distribute variability throughout bacterial genomes.

    <title>On mechanisms of neutral evolution of DNA resulting in scale-free
  behaviour</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a family of models incorporating random segmental substitutions
and point mutations and demonstrate that such models reproduce algebraic length
distributions of exact matches with the slope $-4$ observed earlier in pairwise
comparisons of DNA of distantly related species. It is demonstrated that
power-law distributions of exact matches emerge when shorter sequences transfer
their DNA content to longer sequences, indicating potential mechanisms of the
increased genome complexity.

    <title>Genoogle: an indexed and parallelized search engine for similar DNA
  sequences</title>
    <summary>  The search for similar genetic sequences is one of the main bioinformatics
tasks. The genetic sequences data banks are growing exponentially and the
searching techniques that use linear time are not capable to do the search in
the required time anymore. Another problem is that the clock speed of the
modern processors are not growing as it did before, instead, the processing
capacity is growing with the addiction of more processing cores and the
techniques which does not use parallel computing does not have benefits from
these extra cores. This work aims to use data indexing techniques to reduce the
searching process computation cost united with the parallelization of the
searching techniques to use the computational capacity of the multi core
processors. To verify the viability of using these two techniques
simultaneously, a software which uses parallelization techniques with inverted
indexes was developed.
  Experiments were executed to analyze the performance gain when parallelism is
utilized, the search time gain, and also the quality of the results when it
compared with others searching tools. The results of these experiments were
promising, the parallelism gain overcame the expected speedup, the searching
time was 20 times faster than the parallelized NCBI BLAST, and the searching
results showed a good quality when compared with this tool.

    <title>Analysis of Microarray Data using Artificial Intelligence Based
  Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Microarray is one of the essential technologies used by the biologist to
measure genome-wide expression levels of genes in a particular organism under
some particular conditions or stimuli. As microarrays technologies have become
more prevalent, the challenges of analyzing these data for getting better
insight about biological processes have essentially increased. Due to
availability of artificial intelligence based sophisticated computational
techniques, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic
algorithms, and many other nature-inspired algorithms, it is possible to
analyse microarray gene expression data in more better way. Here, we reviewed
artificial intelligence based techniques for the analysis of microarray gene
expression data. Further, challenges in the field and future work direction
have also been suggested.

    <title>Spaced seeds improve k-mer-based metagenomic classification</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study genetic content of environmental
samples that has been strongly promoted by NGS technologies. To cope with
massive data involved in modern metagenomic projects, recent tools [4, 39] rely
on the analysis of k-mers shared between the read to be classified and sampled
reference genomes. Within this general framework, we show in this work that
spaced seeds provide a significant improvement of classification accuracy as
opposed to traditional contiguous k-mers. We support this thesis through a
series a different computational experiments, including simulations of
large-scale metagenomic projects. Scripts and programs used in this study, as
well as supplementary material, are available from
http://github.com/gregorykucherov/spaced-seeds-for-metagenomics.

    <title>MicroRNAs - targeting and target prediction</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that can regulate many
genes by base pairing to sites in mRNAs. The functionality of miRNAs overlaps
that of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and many features of miRNA targeting
have been revealed experimentally by studying miRNA-mimicking siRNAs. This
review outlines the features associated with animal miRNA targeting and
describes currently available prediction tools.

    <title>Integration of Gene Expression Data and Methylation Reveals Genetic
  Networks for Glioblastoma</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The consistent amount of different types of omics data requires
novel methods of analysis and data integration. In this work we describe
Regression2Net, a computational approach to analyse gene expression and
methylation profiles via regression analysis and network-based techniques.
  Results: We identified 284 and 447 unique candidate genes potentially
associated to the Glioblastoma pathology from two networks inferred from mixed
genetic datasets. In-depth biological analysis of these networks reveals genes
that are related to energy metabolism, cell cycle control (AATF), immune system
response and several types of cancer. Importantly, we observed significant
over- representation of cancer related pathways including glioma especially in
the methylation network. This confirms the strong link between methylation and
glioblastomas. Potential glioma suppressor genes ACCN3 and ACCN4 linked to
NBPF1 neuroblastoma breakpoint family have been identified in our expression
network. Numerous ABC transporter genes (ABCA1, ABCB1) present in the
expression network suggest drug resistance of glioblastoma tumors.

    <title>Fast and accurate approximate inference of transcript expression from
  RNA-seq data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Assigning RNA-seq reads to their transcript of origin is a
fundamental task in transcript expression estimation. Where ambiguities in
assignments exist due to transcripts sharing sequence, e.g. alternative
isoforms or alleles, the problem can be solved through probabilistic inference.
Bayesian methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript abundance
estimates compared to competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is
intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While providing a high degree of
accuracy and modelling flexibility, standard implementations can be
prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex transcriptome annotations.
  Results: We propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and
apply it to an existing model of transcript expression inference from RNA-seq
data. Recent advances in VB algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of
the algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation Maximisation
(VBEM) algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated and biological datasets,
demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in
accuracy of expression level estimation. We carry out a comparative study
against seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new
algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate consistency while
remaining competitive in computation time.
  Availability: The methods were implemented in R and C++, and are available as
part of the BitSeq project at \url{https://github.com/BitSeq}. The method is
also available through the BitSeq Bioconductor package. The source code to
reproduce all simulation results can be accessed via

    <title>Integrative analysis of gene expression and phenotype data</title>
    <summary>  The linking genotype to phenotype is the fundamental aim of modern genetics.
We focus on study of links between gene expression data and phenotype data
through integrative analysis. We propose three approaches.
  1) The inherent complexity of phenotypes makes high-throughput phenotype
profiling a very difficult and laborious process. We propose a method of
automated multi-dimensional profiling which uses gene expression similarity.
Large-scale analysis show that our method can provide robust profiling that
reveals different phenotypic aspects of samples. This profiling technique is
also capable of interpolation and extrapolation beyond the phenotype
information given in training data. It can be used in many applications,
including facilitating experimental design and detecting confounding factors.
  2) Phenotype association analysis problems are complicated by small sample
size and high dimensionality. Consequently, phenotype-associated gene subsets
obtained from training data are very sensitive to selection of training
samples, and the constructed sample phenotype classifiers tend to have poor
generalization properties. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a novel
approach that generates sequences of increasingly discriminative gene cluster
combinations. Our experiments on both simulated and real datasets show robust
and accurate classification performance.
  3) Many complex phenotypes, such as cancer, are the product of not only gene
expression, but also gene interaction. We propose an integrative approach to
find gene network modules that activate under different phenotype conditions.
Using our method, we discovered cancer subtype-specific network modules, as
well as the ways in which these modules coordinate. In particular, we detected
a breast-cancer specific tumor suppressor network module with a hub gene,
PDGFRL, which may play an important role in this module.

    <title>Optimal Seed Solver: Optimizing Seed Selection in Read Mapping</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Optimizing seed selection is an important problem in read
mapping. The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the
sensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds
determines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually
select seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible
placement scheme, both of which limit the potential of the mapper to select
less frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial
to develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and
the seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds.
  Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming
algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an
L-bp read in $O(x \times L)$ operations on average and in $O(x \times L^{2})$
operations in the worst case. We compared OSS against four state-of-the-art
seed selection schemes and observed that OSS provides a 3-fold reduction of
average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations.

    <title>Evaluation of the Number of Different Genomes on Medium and
  Identification of Known Genomes Using Composition Spectra Approach</title>
    <summary>  The article presents the theoretical foundations of the algorithm for
calculating the number of different genomes in the medium under study and of
two algorithms for determining the presence of a particular (known) genome in
this medium. The approach is based on the analysis of the compositional spectra
of subsequently sequenced samples of the medium. The theoretical estimations
required for the implementation of the algorithms are obtained.

    <title>Bermuda: Bidirectional de novo assembly of transcripts with new insights
  for handling uneven coverage</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: RNA-seq has made feasible the analysis of a whole set of
expressed mRNAs. Mapping-based assembly of RNA-seq reads sometimes is
infeasible due to lack of high-quality references. However, de novo assembly is
very challenging due to uneven expression levels among transcripts and also the
read coverage variation within a single transcript. Existing methods either
apply de Bruijn graphs of single-sized k-mers to assemble the full set of
transcripts, or conduct multiple runs of assembly, but still apply graphs of
single-sized k-mers at each run. However, a single k-mer size is not suitable
for all the regions of the transcripts with varied coverage. Contribution: This
paper presents a de novo assembler Bermuda with new insights for handling
uneven coverage. Opposed to existing methods that use a single k-mer size for
all the transcripts in each run of assembly, Bermuda self-adaptively uses a few
k-mer sizes to assemble different regions of a single transcript according to
their local coverage. As such, Bermuda can deal with uneven expression levels
and coverage not only among transcripts, but also within a single transcript.
Extensive tests show that Bermuda outperforms popular de novo assemblers in
reconstructing unevenly-expressed transcripts with longer length, better
contiguity and lower redundancy. Further, Bermuda is computationally efficient
with moderate memory consumption.

    <title>CARGO: Effective format-free compressed storage of genomic information</title>
    <summary>  The recent super-exponential growth in the amount of sequencing data
generated worldwide has put techniques for compressed storage into the focus.
Most available solutions, however, are strictly tied to specific bioinformatics
formats, sometimes inheriting from them suboptimal design choices; this hinders
flexible and effective data sharing. Here we present CARGO (Compressed
ARchiving for GenOmics), a high-level framework to automatically generate
software systems optimized for the compressed storage of arbitrary types of
large genomic data collections. Straightforward applications of our approach to
FASTQ and SAM archives require a few lines of code, produce solutions that
match and sometimes outperform specialized format-tailored compressors, and
scale well to multi-TB datasets.

    <title>Dynamics of Wolbachia pipientis gene expression across the Drosophila
  melanogaster life cycle</title>
    <summary>  Symbiotic interactions between microbes and their multicellular hosts have
manifold impacts on molecular, cellular and organismal biology. To identify
candidate bacterial genes involved in maintaining endosymbiotic associations
with insect hosts, we analyzed genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the
alpha-proteobacteria Wolbachia pipientis across the life cycle of Drosophila
melanogaster using public data from the modENCODE project that was generated in
a Wolbachia-infected version of the ISO1 reference strain. We find that the
majority of Wolbachia genes are expressed at detectable levels in D.
melanogaster across the entire life cycle, but that only 7.8% of 1195 Wolbachia
genes exhibit robust stage- or sex-specific expression differences when studied
in the "holo-organism" context. Wolbachia genes that are differentially
expressed during development are typically up-regulated after D. melanogaster
embryogenesis, and include many bacterial membrane, secretion system and
ankyrin-repeat containing proteins. Sex-biased genes are often organised as
small operons of uncharacterised genes and are mainly up-regulated in adult
males D. melanogaster in an age-dependent manner suggesting a potential role in
cytoplasmic incompatibility. Our results indicate that large changes in
Wolbachia gene expression across the Drosophila life-cycle are relatively rare
when assayed across all host tissues, but that candidate genes to understand
host-microbe interaction in facultative endosymbionts can be successfully
identified using holo-organism expression profiling. Our work also shows that
mining public gene expression data in D. melanogaster provides a rich set of
resources to probe the functional basis of the Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis
and annotate the transcriptional outputs of the Wolbachia genome.

    <title>Detecting somatic mutations in genomic sequences by means of
  Kolmogorov-Arnold analysis</title>
    <summary>  The Kolmogorov-Arnold stochasticity parameter technique is applied for the
first time to the study of cancer genome sequencing, to reveal mutations. Using
data generated by next generation sequencing technologies, we have analyzed the
exome sequences of brain tumor patients with matched tumor and normal blood. We
show that mutations contained in sequencing data can be revealed using this
technique thus providing a new methodology for determining subsequences of
given length containing mutations i.e. its value differs from those of
subsequences without mutations. A potential application for this technique
involves simplifying the procedure of finding segments with mutations, speeding
up genomic research, and accelerating its implementation in clinical
diagnostic. Moreover, the prediction of a mutation associated to a family of
frequent mutations in numerous types of cancers based purely on the value of
the Kolmogorov function, indicates that this applied marker may recognize
genomic sequences that are in extremely low abundance and can be used in
revealing new types of mutations.

    <title>An External-Memory Algorithm for String Graph Construction</title>
    <summary>  Some recent results have introduced external-memory algorithms to compute
self-indexes of a set of strings, mainly via computing the Burrows-Wheeler
Transform (BWT) of the input strings. The motivations for those results stem
from Bioinformatics, where a large number of short strings (called reads) are
routinely produced and analyzed. In that field, a fundamental problem is to
assemble a genome from a large set of much shorter samples extracted from the
unknown genome. The approaches that are currently used to tackle this problem
are memory-intensive. This fact does not bode well with the ongoing increase in
the availability of genomic data. A data structure that is used in genome
assembly is the string graph, where vertices correspond to samples and arcs
represent two overlapping samples. In this paper we address an open problem: to
design an external-memory algorithm to compute the string graph.

    <title>Canonical, Stable, General Mapping using Context Schemes</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Sequence mapping is the cornerstone of modern genomics. However,
most existing sequence mapping algorithms are insufficiently general.
  Results: We introduce context schemes: a method that allows the unambiguous
recognition of a reference base in a query sequence by testing the query for
substrings from an algorithmically defined set. Context schemes only map when
there is a unique best mapping, and define this criterion uniformly for all
reference bases. Mappings under context schemes can also be made stable, so
that extension of the query string (e.g. by increasing read length) will not
alter the mapping of previously mapped positions. Context schemes are general
in several senses. They natively support the detection of arbitrary complex,
novel rearrangements relative to the reference. They can scale over orders of
magnitude in query sequence length. Finally, they are trivially extensible to
more complex reference structures, such as graphs, that incorporate additional
variation. We demonstrate empirically the existence of high performance context
schemes, and present efficient context scheme mapping algorithms.

    <title>Algorithms for finding transposons in gene sequences</title>
    <summary>  With the process of evolution, some genes will change their relative
positions in gene sequence. These "jumping genes" are called transposons.
Through some intuitive rules, we give a criterion to determine transposons
among gene sequences of different individuals of the same species. Then we turn
this problem into graph theory and give algorithms for different situations
with acceptable time complexities. One of these algorithms has been reported
briefly as the "iteration algorithm" in Kang et al.'s paper (in this paper,
transposon is called "core-gene-defined genome organizational framework",
cGOF). This paper provides the omitted details and discussions on general
cases.

    <title>Evaluation of tools for differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq
  on a 48 biological replicate experiment</title>
    <summary>  An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of 2 conditions
was performed to determine the number of biological replicates ($n_r$)
required, and to identify the most effective statistical analysis tools for
identifying differential gene expression (DGE). When $n_r=3$, seven of the nine
tools evaluated give true positive rates (TPR) of only 20 to 40 percent. For
high fold-change genes ($|log_{2}(FC)|\gt2$) the TPR is $\gt85$ percent. Two
tools performed poorly; over- or under-predicting the number of differentially
expressed genes. Increasing replication gives a large increase in TPR when
considering all DE genes but only a small increase for high fold-change genes.
Achieving a TPR $\gt85$% across all fold-changes requires $n_r\gt20$. For
future RNA-seq experiments these results suggest $n_r\gt6$, rising to
$n_r\gt12$ when identifying DGE irrespective of fold-change is important. For
$6 \lt n_r \lt 12$, superior TPR makes edgeR the leading tool tested. For $n_r
\ge12$, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq outperforms the
other tools.

    <title>Spectral Learning of Large Structured HMMs for Comparative Epigenomics</title>
    <summary>  We develop a latent variable model and an efficient spectral algorithm
motivated by the recent emergence of very large data sets of chromatin marks
from multiple human cell types. A natural model for chromatin data in one cell
type is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM); we model the relationship between multiple
cell types by connecting their hidden states by a fixed tree of known
structure. The main challenge with learning parameters of such models is that
iterative methods such as EM are very slow, while naive spectral methods result
in time and space complexity exponential in the number of cell types. We
exploit properties of the tree structure of the hidden states to provide
spectral algorithms that are more computationally efficient for current
biological datasets. We provide sample complexity bounds for our algorithm and
evaluate it experimentally on biological data from nine human cell types.
Finally, we show that beyond our specific model, some of our algorithmic ideas
can be applied to other graphical models.

    <title>PeakSegJoint: fast supervised peak detection via joint segmentation of
  multiple count data samples</title>
    <summary>  Joint peak detection is a central problem when comparing samples in genomic
data analysis, but current algorithms for this task are unsupervised and
limited to at most 2 sample types. We propose PeakSegJoint, a new constrained
maximum likelihood segmentation model for any number of sample types. To select
the number of peaks in the segmentation, we propose a supervised penalty
learning model. To infer the parameters of these two models, we propose to use
a discrete optimization heuristic for the segmentation, and convex optimization
for the penalty learning. In comparisons with state-of-the-art peak detection
algorithms, PeakSegJoint achieves similar accuracy, faster speeds, and a more
interpretable model with overlapping peaks that occur in exactly the same
positions across all samples.

    <title>A read-filtering algorithm for high-throughput marker-gene studies that
  greatly improves OTU accuracy</title>
    <summary>  Adequate read filtering is critical when processing high-throughput data in
marker-gene-based studies. Sequencing errors can cause the mis-clustering of
otherwise similar reads, artificially increasing the number of retrieved
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and therefore leading to the overestimation
of microbial diversity. Sequencing errors will also result in OTUs that are not
accurate reconstructions of the original biological sequences. Herein we
present a novel and sensitive sequence filtering algorithm that minimizes both
problems by calculating the exact error-probability distribution of a sequence
from its quality scores. In order to validate our method, we quality-filtered
thirty-seven publicly available datasets obtained by sequencing mock and
environmental microbial communities with the Roche 454, Illumina MiSeq and
IonTorrent PGM platforms, and compared our results to those obtained with
previous approaches such as the ones included in mothur, QIIME and UPARSE. Our
algorithm retained substantially more reads than its predecessors, while
resulting in fewer and more accurate OTUs. This improved sensitiveness produced
more faithful representations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the
true microbial diversity present in the studied samples. Furthermore, the
method introduced in this work is computationally inexpensive and can be
readily applied in conjunction with any existent analysis pipeline.

extract biologically meaningful knowledge. This review paper presents the
applications of formal concept analysis for the analysis and knowledge
discovery from biological data, including gene expression discretization, gene
co-expression mining, gene expression clustering, finding genes in gene
regulatory networks, enzyme/protein classifications, binding site
classifications, and so on. It also presents a list of FCA-based software tools

    <title>Exploitation of the genomic double-strand breaks to reduce the
  reproductive power of microorganisms</title>
    <summary>  It is shown how to take advantage of the frequent occurrence of double-strand
breaks in the genome of prokaryotic cells, in order to reduce their high
efficient reproductive capability. The analysis examines the physical status of
the free ends of each break and considers how this status can interfere with an
external physical apparatus, with the aim of undermining the repair processes.
We indicate the biological consequences of this interaction and we give an
approximate evaluation of the topological and dynamical effects that arise on
the genomic material involved. The overall result suggests a significant
reduction of the dynamics of the repair.

    <title>Consistency of VDJ rearrangement and substitution parameters enables
  accurate B cell receptor sequence annotation</title>
    <summary>  VDJ rearrangement and somatic hypermutation work together to produce
antibody-coding B cell receptor (BCR) sequences for a remarkable diversity of
antigens. It is now possible to sequence these BCRs in high throughput;
analysis of these sequences is bringing new insight into how antibodies
develop, in particular for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and
influenza. A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each
base as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an
N-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple
parametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden
Markov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via
the same process across sites. However, codon frame and other effects have been
observed to violate these parametric assumptions for such coding sequences,
suggesting that a non-parametric approach to modeling the recombination process
could be useful. In our paper, we find that indeed large modern data sets
suggest a model using parameter-rich per-allele categorical distributions for
HMM transition probabilities and per-allele-per-position mutation
probabilities, and that using such a model for inference leads to significantly
improved results. We present an accurate and efficient BCR sequence annotation
software package using a novel HMM "factorization" strategy. This package,
called partis (https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/), is built on a new
general-purpose HMM compiler that can perform efficient inference given a
simple text description of an HMM.

    <title>Differential protein expression and peak selection in mass spectrometry
  data by binary discriminant analysis</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Proteomic mass spectrometry analysis is becoming routine in
clinical diagnostics, for example to monitor cancer biomarkers using blood
samples. However, differential proteomics and identification of peaks relevant
for class separation remains challenging.
  Results: Here, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying
differentially expressed proteins using binary discriminant analysis. This
approach works by data-adaptive thresholding of protein expression values and
subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative entropy
measure. Our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the `peak
probability contrast' approach of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and can be applied
both in the two-group and the multi-group setting.
  Our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a
large-scale drug discovery test data set equivalent prediction accuracy as a
random forest. Furthermore, we were able to identify in the analysis of mass
spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study biological relevant and
statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study.

    <title>Large-scale Machine Learning for Metagenomics Sequence Classification</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities
by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main
challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each
sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of
metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that
can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard
alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional
approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it
contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. In this work, we
investigate the potential of modern, large-scale machine learning
implementations for taxonomic affectation of next-generation sequencing reads
based on their k-mers profile. We show that machine learning-based
compositional approaches benefit from increasing the number of fragments
sampled from reference genome to tune their parameters, up to a coverage of
about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning these models
involves training a machine learning model on about 10 8 samples in 10 7
dimensions, which is out of reach of standard soft-wares but can be done
efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The
resulting models are competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established
alignment tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate
species, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however,
that compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with
problems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to
sequencing errors. We finally confirm that compositional approach achieve
faster prediction times, with a gain of 3 to 15 times with respect to the
BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the
level of sequencing noise.

    <title>MSPKmerCounter: A Fast and Memory Efficient Approach for K-mer Counting</title>
    <summary>  A major challenge in next-generation genome sequencing (NGS) is to assemble
massive overlapping short reads that are randomly sampled from DNA fragments.
To complete assembling, one needs to finish a fundamental task in many leading
assembly algorithms: counting the number of occurrences of k-mers (length-k
substrings in sequences). The counting results are critical for many components
in assembly (e.g. variants detection and read error correction). For large
genomes, the k-mer counting task can easily consume a huge amount of memory,
making it impossible for large-scale parallel assembly on commodity servers.
  In this paper, we develop MSPKmerCounter, a disk-based approach, to
efficiently perform k-mer counting for large genomes using a small amount of
memory. Our approach is based on a novel technique called Minimum Substring
Partitioning (MSP). MSP breaks short reads into multiple disjoint partitions
such that each partition can be loaded into memory and processed individually.
By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers derived from the same short read,
MSP can achieve astonishing compression ratio so that the I/O cost can be
significantly reduced. For the task of k-mer counting, MSPKmerCounter offers a
very fast and memory-efficient solution. Experiment results on large real-life
short reads data sets demonstrate that MSPKmerCounter can achieve better
overall performance than state-of-the-art k-mer counting approaches.

    <title>Are we far from correctly inferring gene interaction networks with
  Lasso?</title>
    <summary>  Detecting the interactions of genetic compounds like genes, SNPs, proteins,
metabolites, etc. can potentially unravel the mechanisms behind complex traits
and common genetic disorders. Several methods have been taken into
consideration for the analysis of different types of genetic data, regression
being one of the most widely adopted. Without any doubt, a common data type is
represented by gene expression profiles, from which gene regulatory networks
have been inferred with different approaches. In this work we review nine
penalised regression methods applied to microarray data to infer the topology
of the network of interactions. We evaluate each method with respect to the
complexity of biological data. We analyse the limitations of each of them in
order to suggest a number of precautions that should be considered to make
their predictions more significant and reliable.

    <title>Greedy Biomarker Discovery in the Genome with Applications to
  Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
    <summary>  The Set Covering Machine (SCM) is a greedy learning algorithm that produces
sparse classifiers. We extend the SCM for datasets that contain a huge number
of features. The whole genetic material of living organisms is an example of
such a case, where the number of feature exceeds 10^7. Three human pathogens
were used to evaluate the performance of the SCM at predicting antimicrobial
resistance. Our results show that the SCM compares favorably in terms of
sparsity and accuracy against L1 and L2 regularized Support Vector Machines and
CART decision trees. Moreover, the SCM was the only algorithm that could
consider the full feature space. For all other algorithms, the latter had to be
filtered as a preprocessing step.

    <title>An evaluation of DNA-damage response and cell-cycle pathways for breast
  cancer classification</title>
    <summary>  Accurate subtyping or classification of breast cancer is important for
ensuring proper treatment of patients and also for understanding the molecular
mechanisms driving this disease. While there have been several gene signatures
proposed in the literature to classify breast tumours, these signatures show
very low overlaps, different classification performance, and not much relevance
to the underlying biology of these tumours. Here we evaluate DNA-damage
response (DDR) and cell cycle pathways, which are critical pathways implicated
in a considerable proportion of breast tumours, for their usefulness and
ability in breast tumour subtyping. We think that subtyping breast tumours
based on these two pathways could lead to vital insights into molecular
mechanisms driving these tumours. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of
DDR and cell-cycle pathways for subtyping of breast tumours into the five known
intrinsic subtypes. Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway showed the best
performance in subtyping breast tumours, indicating that HR genes are strongly
involved in all breast tumours. Comparisons of pathway based signatures and two
standard gene signatures supported the use of known pathways for breast tumour
subtyping. Further, the evaluation of these standard gene signatures showed
that breast tumour subtyping, prognosis and survival estimation are all closely
related. Finally, we constructed an all-inclusive super-signature by combining
(union of) all genes and performing a stringent feature selection, and found it
to be reasonably accurate and robust in classification as well as prognostic
value. Adopting DDR and cell cycle pathways for breast tumour subtyping
achieved robust and accurate breast tumour subtyping, and constructing a
super-signature which contains feature selected mix of genes from these
molecular pathways as well as clinical aspects is valuable in clinical
practice.

    <title>An exact method to compute a $p$-value for the beyond-pairwise
  correlations among cancer gene mutations</title>
    <summary>  The increasing observation of mutual exclusivity correlations among cancer
gene mutations is a key component for identifying driver events or pathways in
cancer genome analysis. Here we report a rigorous statistical method to compute
an exact $p$-value for the beyond-pairwise mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence
relationships among cancer gene mutations by enumerating a null distribution of
overlapping mutations across more than two genes. The validity and the
advantage of our method is explicitly demonstrated in both cancer gene
mutations and simulation data through the comparison to the permutation test.

    <title>BACOM2: a Java tool for detecting normal cell contamination of copy
  number in heterogeneous tumor</title>
    <summary>  We develop a cross-platform open-source Java application (BACOM2) with
graphic user interface (GUI), and users also can use a XML file to set the
parameters of algorithm model, file paths and the dataset of paired samples.
BACOM2 implements the new entire pipeline of copy number change analysis for
heterogeneous cancer tissues, including extraction of raw copy number signals
from CEL files of paired samples, attenuation correction, identification of
balanced AB-genotype loci, copy number detection and segmentation, global
baseline calculation and absolute normalization, differentiation of deletion
types, estimation of the normal tissue fraction and correction of normal tissue
contamination. BACOM2 focuses on the common tools for data preparation and
absolute normalization for copy number analysis of heterogeneous cancer
tissues. The software provides an additional choice for scientists who require
a user-friendly, high-speed processing, cross-platform computing environment
for large copy number data analysis.

    <title>Near-optimal RNA-Seq quantification</title>
    <summary>  We present a novel approach to RNA-Seq quantification that is near optimal in
speed and accuracy. Software implementing the approach, called kallisto, can be
used to analyze 30 million unaligned paired-end RNA-Seq reads in less than 5
minutes on a standard laptop computer while providing results as accurate as
those of the best existing tools. This removes a major computational bottleneck
in RNA-Seq analysis.

    <title>GWGGI: software for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis</title>
    <summary>  Background: While the importance of gene-gene interactions in human diseases
has been well recognized, identifying them has been a great challenge,
especially through association studies with millions of genetic markers and
thousands of individuals. Computationally efficient and powerful tools are in
great need for the identification of new gene-gene interactions in
high-dimensional association studies. Result: We develop C++ software for
genome-wide gene-gene interaction analyses (GWGGI). GWGGI utilizes tree-based
algorithms to search a large number of genetic markers for a disease-associated
joint association with the consideration of high-order interactions, and then
uses non-parametric statistics to test the joint association. The package
includes two functions, likelihood ratio Mann-whitney (LRMW) and Tree
Assembling Mann-whitney (TAMW).We optimize the data storage and computational
efficiency of the software, making it feasible to run the genome-wide analysis
on a personal computer. The use of GWGGI was demonstrated by using two real
data-sets with nearly 500 k genetic markers. Conclusion: Through the empirical
study, we demonstrated that the genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis
using GWGGI could be accomplished within a reasonable time on a personal
computer (i.e., ~3.5 hours for LRMW and ~10 hours for TAMW). We also showed
that LRMW was suitable to detect interaction among a small number of genetic
variants with moderate-to-strong marginal effect, while TAMW was useful to
detect interaction among a larger number of low-marginal-effect genetic
variants.

    <title>Statistical models for RNA-seq data derived from a two-condition
  48-replicate experiment</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard method to
determine differential gene expression. Identifying differentially expressed
genes crucially depends on estimates of read count variability. These estimates
are typically based on statistical models such as the negative binomial
distribution, which is employed by the tools edgeR, DESeq and cuffdiff. Until
now, the validity of these models has usually been tested on either
low-replicate RNA-seq data or simulations. A 48-replicate RNA-seq experiment in
yeast was performed and data tested against theoretical models. The observed
gene read counts were consistent with both log-normal and negative binomial
distributions, while the mean-variance relation followed the line of constant
dispersion parameter of ~0.01. The high-replicate data also allowed for strict
quality control and screening of bad replicates, which can drastically affect
the gene read-count distribution. RNA-seq data have been submitted to ENA
archive with project ID PRJEB5348.

    <title>Nucleotide 9-mers Characterize the Type II Diabetic Gut Metagenome</title>
    <summary>  Discoveries of new biomarkers for frequently occurring diseases are of
special importance in today's medicine. While fully developed type II diabetes
(T2D) can be detected easily, the early identification of high risk individuals
is an area of interest in T2D, too. Metagenomic analysis of the human bacterial
flora has shown subtle changes in diabetic patients, but no specific microbes
are known to cause or promote the disease. Moderate changes were also detected
in the microbial gene composition of the metagenomes of diabetic patients, but
again, no specific gene was found that is present in disease-related and
missing in healthy metagenome. However, these fine differences in microbial
taxon- and gene composition are difficult to apply as quantitative biomarkers
for diagnosing or predicting type II diabetes. In the present work we report
some nucleotide 9-mers with significantly differing frequencies in diabetic and
healthy intestinal flora. To our knowledge, it is the first time such short DNA
fragments have been associated with T2D. The automated, quantitative analysis
of the frequencies of short nucleotide sequences seems to be more feasible than
accurate phylogenetic and functional analysis, and thus it might be a promising
direction of diagnostic research.

    <title>Joint Inference of Genome Structure and Content in Heterogeneous Tumour
  Samples</title>
    <summary>  For a genomically unstable cancer, a single tumour biopsy will often contain
a mixture of competing tumour clones. These tumour clones frequently differ
with respect to their genomic content (copy number of each gene) and structure
(order of genes on each chromosome). Modern bulk genome sequencing mixes the
signals of tumour clones and contaminating normal cells, complicating inference
of genomic content and structure. We propose a method to unmix tumour and
contaminating normal signals and jointly predict genomic structure and content
of each tumour clone. We use genome graphs to represent tumour clones, and
model the likelihood of the observed reads given clones and mixing proportions.
Our use of haplotype blocks allows us to accurately measure allele specific
read counts, and infer allele specific copy number for each clone. The proposed
method is a heuristic local search based on applying incremental, locally
optimal modifications of the genome graphs. Using simulated data, we show that
our method predicts copy counts and gene adjacencies with reasonable accuracy.

    <title>benchNGS : An approach to benchmark short reads alignment tools</title>
    <summary>  In the last decade a number of algorithms and associated software have been
developed to align next generation sequencing (NGS) reads with relevant
reference genomes. The accuracy of these programs may vary significantly,
especially when the NGS reads are quite different from the available reference
genome. We propose a benchmark to assess accuracy of short reads mapping based
on the pre-computed global alignment of related genome sequences.
  In this paper we propose a benchmark to assess accuracy of the short reads
mapping based on the pre-computed global alignment of closely related genome
sequences. We outline the method and also present a short report of an
experiment performed on five popular alignment tools based on the pairwise
alignments of Escherichia coli O6 CFT073 genome with genomes of seven other
bacteria.

    <title>FermiKit: assembly-based variant calling for Illumina resequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Summary: FermiKit is a variant calling pipeline for Illumina data. It de novo
assembles short reads and then maps the assembly against a reference genome to
call SNPs, short insertions/deletions (INDELs) and structural variations (SVs).
FermiKit takes about one day to assemble 30-fold human whole-genome data on a
modern 16-core server with 85GB RAM at the peak, and calls variants in half an
hour to an accuracy comparable to the current practice. FermiKit assembly is a
reduced representation of raw data while retaining most of the original
information.

longer reads produced by some NGS platforms in order to estimate a population
of haplotypes. Our goal here is to take advantage of distinct virtues of a
certain kind of NGS platform - the platform SOLiD (Life Technologies) is an
example - that has not received much attention due to the short length of its
reads, which renders haplotype estimation very difficult. However, this kind of
platform has a very low error rate and extremely deep coverage per site and our
method is designed to take advantage of these characteristics. We propose to
measure the populational genetic diversity through a family of multinomial
probability distributions indexed by the sites of the virus genome, each one
representing the populational distribution of the diversity per site. The
implementation of the method focuses on two main optimization strategies: a
read mapping/alignment procedure that aims at the recovery of the maximum
possible number of short-reads; the estimation of the multinomial parameters
through a Bayesian approach, which, unlike simple frequency counting, allows
one to take into account the prior information of the control population within
the inference of a posterior experimental condition and provides a natural way
to separate signal from noise, since it automatically furnishes Bayesian
confidence intervals. The methods described in this paper have been implemented
as an integrated tool called Tanden (Tool for Analysis of Diversity in Viral
Populations).

    <title>Improved Core Genes Prediction for Constructing well-supported
  Phylogenetic Trees in large sets of Plant Species</title>
    <summary>  The way to infer well-supported phylogenetic trees that precisely reflect the
evolutionary process is a challenging task that completely depends on the way
the related core genes have been found. In previous computational biology
studies, many similarity based algorithms, mainly dependent on calculating
sequence alignment matrices, have been proposed to find them. In these kinds of
approaches, a significantly high similarity score between two coding sequences
extracted from a given annotation tool means that one has the same genes. In a
previous work article, we presented a quality test approach (QTA) that improves
the core genes quality by combining two annotation tools (namely NCBI, a
partially human-curated database, and DOGMA, an efficient annotation algorithm
for chloroplasts). This method takes the advantages from both sequence
similarity and gene features to guarantee that the core genome contains correct
and well-clustered coding sequences (\emph{i.e.}, genes). We then show in this
article how useful are such well-defined core genes for biomolecular
phylogenetic reconstructions, by investigating various subsets of core genes at
various family or genus levels, leading to subtrees with strong bootstraps that
are finally merged in a well-supported supertree.

    <title>Introgression Browser: High throughput whole-genome SNP visualization</title>
    <summary>  Breeding by introgressive hybridization is a pivotal strategy to broaden the
genetic basis of crops. Usually, the desired traits are monitored in
consecutive crossing generations by marker-assisted selection, but their
analyses fail in chromosome regions where crossover recombinants are rare or
not viable. Here, we present the Introgression Browser (IBROWSER), a novel
bioinformatics tool aimed at visualizing introgressions at nucleotide or SNP
accuracy. The software selects homozygous SNPs from Variant Call Format (VCF)
information and filters out heterozygous SNPs, Multi-Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(MNPs) and insertion-deletions (InDels). For data analysis IBROWSER makes use
of sliding windows, but if needed it can generate any desired fragmentation
pattern through General Feature Format (GFF) information. In an example of
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) accessions we visualize SNP patterns and
elucidate both position and boundaries of the introgressions. We also show that
our tool is capable of identifying alien DNA in a panel of the closely related
S. pimpinellifolium by examining phylogenetic relationships of the introgressed
segments in tomato. In a third example, we demonstrate the power of the
IBROWSER in a panel of 600 Arabidopsis accessions, detecting the boundaries of
a SNP-free region around a polymorphic 1.17 Mbp inverted segment on the short
arm of chromosome 4. The architecture and functionality of IBROWSER makes the
software appropriate for a broad set of analyses including SNP mining, genome
structure analysis, and pedigree analysis. Its functionality, together with the
capability to process large data sets and efficient visualization of sequence
variation, makes IBROWSER a valuable breeding tool.

    <title>Exploring genetic variation in the tomato (Solanum section Lycopersicon)
  clade by whole-genome sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Genetic variation in the tomato clade was explored by sequencing a selection
of 84 tomato accessions and related wild species representative for the
Lycopersicon, Arcanum, Eriopersicon, and Neolycopersicon groups. We present a
reconstruction of three new reference genomes in support of our comparative
genome analyses. Sequence diversity in commercial breeding lines appears
extremely low, indicating the dramatic genetic erosion of crop tomatoes. This
is reflected by the SNP count in wild species which can exceed 10 million i.e.
20 fold higher than in crop accessions. Comparative sequence alignment reveals
group, species, and accession specific polymorphisms, which explain
characteristic fruit traits and growth habits in tomato accessions. Using gene
models from the annotated Heinz reference genome, we observe a bias in dN/dS
ratio in fruit and growth diversification genes compared to a random set of
genes, which probably is the result of a positive selection. We detected highly
divergent segments in wild S. lycopersicum species, and footprints of
introgressions in crop accessions originating from a common donor accession.
Phylogenetic relationships of fruit diversification and growth specific genes
from crop accessions show incomplete resolution and are dependent on the
introgression donor. In contrast, whole genome SNP information has sufficient
power to resolve the phylogenetic placement of each accession in the four main
groups in the Lycopersicon clade using Maximum Likelihood analyses.
Phylogenetic relationships appear correlated with habitat and mating type and
point to the occurrence of geographical races within these groups and thus are
of practical importance for introgressive hybridization breeding. Our study
illustrates the need for multiple reference genomes in support of tomato
comparative genomics and Solanum genome evolution studies.

    <title>Triander: A new program for visual analysis of nucleotide sequences</title>
    <summary>  The Triander program is an interactive software package for nucleotide
sequence visualization. The program was developed using the freeware Pascal RAD
IDE Lazarus, and its source code and binaries compiled for Windows are freely
accessible at http://www.icbge.org.ua/eng/Triander . Triander can produce four
types of plots. It is possible to build three DNA walks independently for each
nucleotide position in triplets. The use of nucleotide vectors with unequal
modulus leads to a significant reduction in the visual information lost in DNA
walks. The program can be used in the investigation of the fine structure of
sequences, to find standard patterns in them and to locate nontrivial regions
for further detailed analysis.

    <title>On the readability of overlap digraphs</title>
    <summary>  We introduce the graph parameter readability and study it as a function of
the number of vertices in a graph. Given a digraph D, an injective overlap
labeling assigns a unique string to each vertex such that there is an arc from
x to y if and only if x properly overlaps y. The readability of D is the
minimum string length for which an injective overlap labeling exists. In
applications that utilize overlap digraphs (e.g., in bioinformatics),
readability reflects the length of the strings from which the overlap digraph
is constructed. We study the asymptotic behaviour of readability by casting it
in purely graph theoretic terms (without any reference to strings). We prove
upper and lower bounds on readability for certain graph families and general
graphs

    <title>Differential stoichiometry among core ribosomal proteins</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the regulation and structure of ribosomes is essential to
understanding protein synthesis and its deregulation in disease. While
ribosomes are believed to have a fixed stoichiometry among their core ribosomal
proteins (RPs), some experiments suggest a more variable composition. Testing
such variability requires direct and precise quantification of RPs. We used
mass-spectrometry to directly quantify RPs across monosomes and polysomes of
mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and budding yeast. Our data show that the
stoichiometry among core RPs in wild-type yeast cells and ESC depends both on
the growth conditions and on the number of ribosomes bound per mRNA.
Furthermore, we find that the fitness of cells with a deleted RP-gene is
inversely proportional to the enrichment of the corresponding RP in polysomes.
Together, our findings support the existence of ribosomes with distinct protein
composition and physiological function.

    <title>Computational reconstruction of mitochondria-encoded mammal ancestral
  proteins</title>
    <summary>  A method based on mapping a symbolic sequence into a set of patterns (strings
resulting from the sequence parsing) is proposed as a tool for the
reconstruction of ancestral sequences. The set union of patterns comprises all
the patterns present in the family of related proteins sequences of an extant
species. The set of most frequent patterns among protein sequences is selected
and concatenated. The resulting sequence of amino acids is supposed to be the
ancestral protein of the family. No sequences alignment and phylogenetic tree
of the species family are necessary. The method is used for inferring the
ancestral amino acid sequences of thirteen mitochondria-encoded protein
families of mammal species. Statistical distribution of the similarity between
extant and ancestral sequences exhibits some structures related to
environmental changes in the past.

    <title>Más allá del GWAS: alternativas para localizar QTLs</title>
    <summary>  Beyond GWAS: alternatives to localize QTLs in farm animals. Two methods that
could be used for QTL mapping as alternatives to standard GWAS are presented.
The first relies on the differential frequency of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in
groups of animals (e.g. cases and controls), while the second stems from
resampling techniques used for the prediction of carriers of a mutation, and is
based on the frequency of inclusion of polymorphisms (SNP) in the predictive
model. ROH were applied to the detection of reproductive diseases in
Holstein-Friesian cattle, while resampling was applied to the detection of
carriers of the BH2 haplotype in Brown Swiss cattle. These alternative
approaches may complement GWAS analyses in localizing more accurately QTLs for
traits of interest in livestock.

    <title>Monte Carlo Null Models for Genomic Data</title>
    <summary>  As increasingly complex hypothesis-testing scenarios are considered in many
scientific fields, analytic derivation of null distributions is often out of
reach. To the rescue comes Monte Carlo testing, which may appear deceptively
simple: as long as you can sample test statistics under the null hypothesis,
the $p$-value is just the proportion of sampled test statistics that exceed the
observed test statistic. Sampling test statistics is often simple once you have
a Monte Carlo null model for your data, and defining some form of randomization
procedure is also, in many cases, relatively straightforward. However, there
may be several possible choices of a randomization null model for the data and
no clear-cut criteria for choosing among them. Obviously, different null models
may lead to very different $p$-values, and a very low $p$-value may thus occur
due to the inadequacy of the chosen null model. It is preferable to use
assumptions about the underlying random data generation process to guide
selection of a null model. In many cases, we may order the null models by
increasing preservation of the data characteristics, and we argue in this paper
that this ordering in most cases gives increasing $p$-values, that is, lower
significance. We denote this as the null complexity principle. The principle
gives a better understanding of the different null models and may guide in the
choice between the different models.

    <title>PopIns: population-scale detection of novel sequence insertions</title>
    <summary>  The detection of genomic structural variation (SV) has advanced tremendously
in recent years due to progress in high-throughput sequencing technologies.
Novel sequence insertions, insertions without similarity to a human reference
genome, have received less attention than other types of SVs due to the
computational challenges in their detection from short read sequencing data,
which inherently involves de novo assembly. De novo assembly is not only
computationally challenging, but also requires high-quality data. While the
reads from a single individual may not always meet this requirement, using
reads from multiple individuals can increase power to detect novel insertions.
We have developed the program PopIns, which can discover and characterize
non-reference insertions of 100 bp or longer on a population scale. In this
paper, we describe the approach we implemented in PopIns. It takes as input a
reads-to-reference alignment, assembles unaligned reads using a standard
assembly tool, merges the contigs of different individuals into high-confidence
sequences, anchors the merged sequences into the reference genome, and finally
genotypes all individuals for the discovered insertions. Our tests on simulated
data indicate that the merging step greatly improves the quality and
reliability of predicted insertions and that PopIns shows significantly better
recall and precision than the recent tool MindTheGap. Preliminary results on a
data set of 305 Icelanders demonstrate the practicality of the new approach.
The source code of PopIns is available from http://github.com/bkehr/popins.

    <title>Rapid host switching in generalist Campylobacter strains erodes the
  signal for tracing human infections</title>
    <summary>  Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the biggest causes of
bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world, with human infections
typically arising from zoonotic transmission associated with infected meat,
especially poultry. Because this organism is not thought to survive well
outside of the gut, host associated populations are genetically isolated to
varying degrees. Therefore the likely origin of most Campylobacter strains can
be determined by host-associated variation in the genome. This is instructive
for characterizing the source of human infection at the population level.
However, some common strains appear to have broad host ranges, hindering source
attribution. Whole genome sequencing has the potential to reveal fine-scale
genetic structure associated with host specificity within each of these
strains.
  We found that rates of zoonotic transmission among animal host species in
ST-21, ST-45 and ST-828 clonal complexes were so high that the signal of host
association is all but obliterated. We attributed 89% of clinical cases to a
chicken source, 10% to cattle and 1% to pig. Our results reveal that common
strains of C. jejuni and C. coli infectious to humans are adapted to a
generalist lifestyle, permitting rapid transmission between different hosts.
Furthermore, they show that the weak signal of host association within these
complexes presents a challenge for pinpointing the source of clinical
infections, underlining the view that whole genome sequencing, powerful though
it is, cannot substitute for intensive sampling of suspected transmission
reservoirs.

    <title>Utilizing de Bruijn graph of metagenome assembly for metatranscriptome
  analysis</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics research has accelerated the studies of microbial organisms,
providing insights into the composition and potential functionality of various
microbial communities. Metatranscriptomics (studies of the transcripts from a
mixture of microbial species) and other meta-omics approaches hold even greater
promise for providing additional insights into functional and regulatory
characteristics of the microbial communities. Current metatranscriptomics
projects are often carried out without matched metagenomic datasets (of the
same microbial communities). For the projects that produce both
metatranscriptomic and metagenomic datasets, their analyses are often not
integrated. Metagenome assemblies are far from perfect, partially explaining
why metagenome assemblies are not used for the analysis of metatranscriptomic
datasets. Here we report a reads mapping algorithm for mapping of short reads
onto a de Bruijn graph of assemblies. A hash table of junction k-mers (k-mers
spanning branching structures in the de Bruijn graph) is used to facilitate
fast mapping of reads to the graph. We developed an application of this mapping
algorithm: a reference based approach to metatranscriptome assembly using
graphs of metagenome assembly as the reference. Our results show that this new
approach (called TAG) helps to assemble substantially more transcripts that
otherwise would have been missed or truncated because of the fragmented nature
of the reference metagenome. TAG was implemented in C++ and has been tested
extensively on the linux platform. It is available for download as open source
at http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/TAG.

    <title>Ultra-large alignments using Phylogeny-aware Profiles</title>
    <summary>  Many biological questions, including the estimation of deep evolutionary
histories and the detection of remote homology between protein sequences, rely
upon multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and phylogenetic trees of large
datasets. However, accurate large-scale multiple sequence alignment is very
difficult, especially when the dataset contains fragmentary sequences. We
present UPP, an MSA method that uses a new machine learning technique - the
Ensemble of Hidden Markov Models - that we propose here. UPP produces highly
accurate alignments for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences, even on
ultra-large datasets or datasets containing fragmentary sequences. UPP is
available at https://github.com/smirarab/sepp.

    <title>Inference of Markovian Properties of Molecular Sequences from NGS Data
  and Applications to Comparative Genomics</title>
    <summary>  Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies generate large amounts of short
read data for many different organisms. The fact that NGS reads are generally
short makes it challenging to assemble the reads and reconstruct the original
genome sequence. For clustering genomes using such NGS data, word-count based
alignment-free sequence comparison is a promising approach, but for this
approach, the underlying expected word counts are essential.
  A plausible model for this underlying distribution of word counts is given
through modelling the DNA sequence as a Markov chain (MC). For single long
sequences, efficient statistics are available to estimate the order of MCs and
the transition probability matrix for the sequences. As NGS data do not provide
a single long sequence, inference methods on Markovian properties of sequences
based on single long sequences cannot be directly used for NGS short read data.
  Here we derive a normal approximation for such word counts. We also show that
the traditional Chi-square statistic has an approximate gamma distribution,
using the Lander-Waterman model for physical mapping. We propose several
methods to estimate the order of the MC based on NGS reads and evaluate them
using simulations. We illustrate the applications of our results by clustering
genomic sequences of several vertebrate and tree species based on NGS reads
using alignment-free sequence dissimilarity measures. We find that the
estimated order of the MC has a considerable effect on the clustering results,
and that the clustering results that use a MC of the estimated order give a
plausible clustering of the species.

    <title>RNF: a general framework to evaluate NGS read mappers</title>
    <summary>  Aligning reads to a reference sequence is a fundamental step in numerous
bioinformatics pipelines. As a consequence, the sensitivity and precision of
the mapping tool, applied with certain parameters to certain data, can
critically affect the accuracy of produced results (e.g., in variant calling
applications). Therefore, there has been an increasing demand of methods for
comparing mappers and for measuring effects of their parameters.
  Read simulators combined with alignment evaluation tools provide the most
straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers. Simulation of reads is
accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This
information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper.
Finally, reports containing statistics of successful read alignments are
created.
  In default of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has
to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads. In
order to solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format RNF (Read Naming
Format) for assigning read names with encoded information about original
positions.
  Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package RNF containing
two principal components. MIShmash applies one of popular read simulating tools
(among DwgSim, Art, Mason, CuReSim etc.) and transforms the generated reads
into RNF format. LAVEnder evaluates then a given read mapper using simulated
reads in RNF format. A special attention is payed to mapping qualities that
serve for parametrization of ROC curves, and to evaluation of the effect of
read sample contamination.

    <title>Increased signaling entropy in cancer requires the scale-free property
  of protein interaction networks</title>
    <summary>  One of the key characteristics of cancer cells is an increased phenotypic
plasticity, driven by underlying genetic and epigenetic perturbations. However,
at a systems-level it is unclear how these perturbations give rise to the
observed increased plasticity. Elucidating such systems-level principles is key
for an improved understanding of cancer. Recently, it has been shown that
signaling entropy, an overall measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, and
computable from integrating a sample's gene expression profile with a protein
interaction network, correlates with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in
cancer compared to normal tissue. Here we develop a computational framework for
studying the effects of network perturbations on signaling entropy. We
demonstrate that the increased signaling entropy of cancer is driven by two
factors: (i) the scale-free (or near scale-free) topology of the interaction
network, and (ii) a subtle positive correlation between differential gene
expression and node connectivity. Indeed, we show that if protein interaction
networks were random graphs, described by Poisson degree distributions, that
cancer would generally not exhibit an increased signaling entropy. In summary,
this work exposes a deep connection between cancer, signaling entropy and
interaction network topology.

    <title>Hox genes underlie metazoan development, but what controls them?</title>
    <summary>  Although metazoan development is conceived as resulting from gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) controlled by Hox genes, a better analogy is computer
architecture: i.e., a task accomplished in sequential steps linked to an
external referent that "counts" each step. A developmental "step" equals the
expression of genes in specific cells at specific times and telomeres represent
external "counters" wherein "counting" is a function of telomere shortening at
each cell division that permits the sequential expression of Hox genes and,
ultimately, complex form. Metazoan development thus best resembles a Turing
machine, which could be used to model the development of any metazoan.

    <title>Beyond the E-value: stratified statistics for protein domain prediction</title>
    <summary>  E-values have been the dominant statistic for protein sequence analysis for
the past two decades: from identifying statistically significant local sequence
alignments to evaluating matches to hidden Markov models describing protein
domain families. Here we formally show that for "stratified" multiple
hypothesis testing problems, controlling the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR)
per stratum, or partition, yields the most predictions across the data at any
given threshold on the FDR or E-value over all strata combined. For the
important problem of protein domain prediction, a key step in characterizing
protein structure, function and evolution, we show that stratifying statistical
tests by domain family yields excellent results. We develop the first
FDR-estimating algorithms for domain prediction, and evaluate how well
thresholds based on q-values, E-values and lFDRs perform in domain prediction
using five complementary approaches for estimating empirical FDRs in this
context. We show that stratified q-value thresholds substantially outperform
E-values. Contradicting our theoretical results, q-values also outperform
lFDRs; however, our tests reveal a small but coherent subset of domain
families, biased towards models for specific repetitive patterns, for which
FDRs are greatly underestimated due to weaknesses in random sequence models.
Usage of lFDR thresholds outperform q-values for the remaining families, which
have as-expected noise, suggesting that further improvements in domain
predictions can be achieved with improved modeling of random sequences.
Overall, our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the use of
stratified q-values and lFDRs could result in improvements in a host of
structured multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in bioinformatics,
including genome-wide association studies, orthology prediction, motif
scanning, and multi-microarray analyses.

    <title>Long and short range multi-locus QTL interactions in a complex trait of
  yeast</title>
    <summary>  We analyse interactions of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in heat selected
yeast by comparing them to an unselected pool of random individuals. Here we
re-examine data on individual F12 progeny selected for heat tolerance, which
have been genotyped at 25 locations identified by sequencing a selected pool
[Parts, L., Cubillos, F. A., Warringer, J., Jain, K., Salinas, F., Bumpstead,
S. J., Molin, M., Zia, A., Simpson, J. T., Quail, M. A., Moses, A., Louis, E.
J., Durbin, R., and Liti, G. (2011). Genome research, 21(7), 1131-1138]. 960
individuals were genotyped at these locations and multi-locus genotype
frequencies were compared to 172 sequenced individuals from the original
unselected pool (a control group). Various non-random associations were found
across the genome, both within chromosomes and between chromosomes. Some of the
non-random associations are likely due to retention of linkage disequilibrium
in the F12 population, however many, including the inter-chromosomal
interactions, must be due to genetic interactions in heat tolerance. One region
of particular interest involves 3 linked loci on chromosome IV where the
central variant responsible for heat tolerance is antagonistic, coming from the
heat sensitive parent and the flanking ones are from the more heat tolerant
parent. The 3-locus haplotypes in the selected individuals represent a highly
biased sample of the population haplotypes with rare double recombinants in
high frequency. These were missed in the original analysis and would never be
seen without the multigenerational approach. We show that a statistical
analysis of entropy and information gain in genotypes of a selected population
can reveal further interactions than previously seen. Importantly this must be
done in comparison to the unselected population's genotypes to account for
inherent biases in the original population.

    <title>Single cell visualization of transcription kinetics variance of highly
  mobile identical genes using 3D nanoimaging</title>
    <summary>  Both multi-cell biochemical assays and single cell fluorescence measurements
have revealed that the elongation rate of Polymerase II (PolII) in eukaryotes
varies largely across different cell types and genes. However, there is not yet
a consensus whether intrinsic factors such as the position, local mobility or
the engagement by an active molecular mechanism of a genetic locus could be the
determinants of the observed heterogeneity. Employing high-speed 3D
fluorescence nanoimaging we resolve here at the single cell level multiple,
distinct regions of mRNA synthesis within a labeled transgene array. By
employing phasor analysis, a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy technique,
we demonstrate that these regions are active transcription sites that release
mRNA molecules in the nucleoplasm, and we extract the local PolII elongation
rate. While we detect a range of 10-100 bp/s for PolII elongation from cell to
cell, we are now also able to measure up to a four-fold variation in the
average elongation between identical copies of the same gene measured
simultaneously within the same cell. Furthermore, we are able to visualize
changes of PolII elongation as a function of time. We observe a correlation
between the average elongation rate measured in a locus and its local mobility.
Finally, by cross-correlating the transcriptional activity with the nm-sized
movements of the active loci, we provide evidence of an active molecular
mechanism determining displacements of the transcription sites concomitant to
increases in transcriptional activity. Together these observations demonstrate
that local factors, such as chromatin local mobility and the microenvironment
of the transcription site, are an important source of transcription kinetics
variability.

    <title>Reliable scaling of Position Weight Matrices for binding strength
  comparisons between transcription factors</title>
    <summary>  Scoring DNA sequences against Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) is a widely
adopted method to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. While
common bioinformatics tools produce scores that can reflect the binding
strength between a specific transcription factor and the DNA, these scores are
not directly comparable between different transcription factors. Here, we
provide two different ways to find the scaling parameter $\lambda$ that allows
us to infer binding energy from a PWM score. The first approach uses a PWM and
background genomic sequence as input to estimate $\lambda$ for a specific
transcription factor, which we applied to show that $\lambda$ distributions for
different transcription factor families correspond with their DNA binding
properties. Our second method can reliably convert $\lambda$ between different
PWMs of the same transcription factor, which allows us to directly compare PWMs
that were generated by different approaches. These two approaches provide
consistent and computationally efficient ways to scale PWMs scores and estimate
transcription factor binding sites strength.

    <title>Correlations between promoter activity and its nucleotide positions in
  spacing region</title>
    <summary>  Transcription is one of the essential processes for cells to read genetic
information encoded in genes, which is initiated by the binding of RNA
polymerase to related promoter. Experiments have found that the nucleotide
sequence of promoter has great influence on gene expression strength, or
promoter activity. In synthetic biology, one interesting question is how we can
synthesize a promoter with given activity, and which positions of promoter
sequence are important for determining its activity. In this study, based on
recent experimental data, correlations between promoter activity and its
sequence positions are analyzed by various methods. Our results show that,
except nucleotides in the two highly conserved regions, $-35$ box and $-10$
box, influences of nucleotides in other positions are also not neglectable. For
example, modifications of nucleotides around position $-19$ in spacing region
may change promoter activity in a large scale. The results of this study might
be helpful to our understanding of biophysical mechanism of gene transcription,
and may also be helpful to the design of synthetic cell factory.

    <title>Modelling Computational Resources for Next Generation Sequencing
  Bioinformatics Analysis of 16S rRNA Samples</title>
    <summary>  In the rapidly evolving domain of next generation sequencing and
bioinformatics analysis, data generation is one aspect that is increasing at a
concomitant rate. The burden associated with processing large amounts of
sequencing data has emphasised the need to allocate sufficient computing
resources to complete analyses in the shortest possible time with manageable
and predictable costs. A novel method for predicting time to completion for a
popular bioinformatics software (QIIME), was developed using key variables
characteristic of the input data assumed to impact processing time. Multiple
Linear Regression models were developed to determine run time for two denoising
algorithms and a general bioinformatics pipeline. The models were able to
accurately predict clock time for denoising sequences from a naturally
assembled community dataset, but not an artificial community. Speedup and
efficiency tests for AmpliconNoise also highlighted that caution was needed
when allocating resources for parallel processing of data. Accurate modelling
of computational processing time using easily measurable predictors can assist
NGS analysts in determining resource requirements for bioinformatics software
and pipelines. Whilst demonstrated on a specific group of scripts, the
methodology can be extended to encompass other packages running on multiple
architectures, either in parallel or sequentially.

    <title>An investigation into inter- and intragenomic variations of graphic
  genomic signatures</title>
    <summary>  We provide, on an extensive dataset and using several different distances,
confirmation of the hypothesis that CGR patterns are preserved along a genomic
DNA sequence, and are different for DNA sequences originating from genomes of
different species. This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs of
genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. In particular, we
compare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic
sequences originating from the genomes of six organisms, each belonging to one
of the kingdoms of life: H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana, P. falciparum,
E. coli, and P. furiosus. We also provide preliminary evidence of this method's
applicability to closely related species by comparing H. sapiens (chromosome
21) sequences and over one hundred and fifty genomic sequences, also 150,000 bp
long, from P. troglodytes (Animalia; chromosome Y), for a total length of more
than 101 million basepairs analyzed. We compute pairwise distances between CGRs
of these genomic sequences using six different distances, and construct
Molecular Distance Maps that visualize all sequences as points in a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, to simultaneously display their
interrelationships. Our analysis confirms that CGR patterns of DNA sequences
from the same genome are in general quantitatively similar, while being
different for DNA sequences from genomes of different species. Our analysis of
the performance of the assessed distances uses three different quality measures
and suggests that several distances outperform the Euclidean distance, which
has so far been almost exclusively used for such studies. In particular we show
that, for this dataset, DSSIM (Structural Dissimilarity Index) and the
descriptor distance (introduced here) are best able to classify genomic
sequences.

    <title>Ecological patterns of genome size variation and the origin of species
  in salamanders</title>
    <summary>  Salamanders (urodela) have among the largest vertebrate genomes, ranging in
size from 10 to over 80 pg. The urodela are divided into ten extant families
each with a characteristic range in genome size. Although changes in genome
size often occur randomly and in the absence of selection pressure, non-random
patterns of genome size variation are evident among specific vertebrate
lineages. Here we report that genome size in salamander families varies
inversely with species richness and other ecological factors: clades that began
radiating earlier (older crown age) tend to have smaller genomes, higher levels
of diversity and larger geographical ranges. These observations support the
hypothesis that urodel families with larger genomes either have a lower
propensity to diversify or are more vulnerable to extinction than families with
smaller genomes.

    <summary>  The genetic structure of human populations is extraordinarily complex and of
fundamental importance to studies of anthropology, evolution, and medicine.
  As increasingly many individuals are of mixed origin, there is an unmet need
for tools that can infer multiple origins. Misclassification of such
individuals can lead to incorrect and costly misinterpretations of genomic
data, primarily in disease studies and drug trials.
  We present an advanced tool to infer ancestry that can identify the
biogeographic origins of highly mixed individuals.

    <title>GDC 2: Compression of large collections of genomes</title>
    <summary>  The fall of prices of the high-throughput genome sequencing changes the
landscape of modern genomics. A number of large scale projects aimed at
sequencing many human genomes are in progress. Genome sequencing also becomes
an important aid in the personalized medicine. One of the significant side
effects of this change is a necessity of storage and transfer of huge amounts
of genomic data. In this paper we deal with the problem of compression of large
collections of complete genomic sequences. We propose an algorithm that is able
to compress the collection of 1092 human diploid genomes about 9,500 times.
This result is about 4 times better than what is offered by the other existing
compressors. Moreover, our algorithm is very fast as it processes the data with
speed 200MB/s on a modern workstation. In a consequence the proposed algorithm
allows storing the complete genomic collections at low cost, e.g., the examined
collection of 1092 human genomes needs only about 700MB when compressed, what

    <title>Probabilistic models of genetic variation in structured populations
  applied to global human studies</title>
    <summary>  Modern population genetics studies typically involve genome-wide genotyping
of individuals from a diverse network of ancestries. An important, unsolved
problem is how to formulate and estimate probabilistic models of observed
genotypes that allow for complex population structure. We formulate two general
probabilistic models, and we propose computationally efficient algorithms to
estimate them. First, we show how principal component analysis (PCA) can be
utilized to estimate a general model that includes the well-known
Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly mixed-membership model as a special case. Noting
some drawbacks of this approach, we introduce a new "logistic factor analysis"
(LFA) framework that seeks to directly model the logit transformation of
probabilities underlying observed genotypes in terms of latent variables that
capture population structure. We demonstrate these advances on data from the
human genome diversity panel and 1000 genomes project, where we are able to
identify SNPs that are highly differentiated with respect to structure while
making minimal modeling assumptions.

    <title>HetFHMM: A novel approach to infer tumor heterogeneity using factorial
  Hidden Markov model</title>
    <summary>  Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations which generate tumor cells
with different genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and
therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample
accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either
computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of
mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of
clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we
propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting
clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific
genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic
location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results
shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity.
Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.

    <title>Metabolic and Chaperone Gene Loss Marks the Origin of Animals: Evidence
  for Hsp104 and Hsp78 Sharing Mitochondrial Clients</title>
    <summary>  The evolution of animals involved acquisition of an emergent gene repertoire
for gastrulation. Whether loss of genes also co-evolved with this developmental
reprogramming has not yet been addressed. Here, we identify twenty-four genetic
functions that are retained in fungi and choanoflagellates but undetectable in
animals. These lost genes encode: (i) sixteen distinct biosynthetic functions;
(ii) the two ancestral eukaryotic ClpB disaggregases, Hsp78 and Hsp104, which
function in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively; and (iii) six other
assorted functions. We present computational and experimental data that are
consistent with a joint function for the differentially localized ClpB
disaggregases, and with the possibility of a shared client/chaperone
relationship between the mitochondrial Fe/S homoaconitase encoded by the lost
LYS4 gene and the two ClpBs. Our analyses lead to the hypothesis that the
evolution of gastrulation-based multicellularity in animals led to efficient
extraction of nutrients from dietary sources, loss of natural selection for
maintenance of energetically expensive biosynthetic pathways, and subsequent
loss of their attendant ClpB chaperones.

    <title>Inferring processes underlying B-cell repertoire diversity</title>
    <summary>  We quantify the VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation processes in
human B-cells using probabilistic inference methods on high-throughput DNA
sequence repertoires of human B-cell receptor heavy chains. Our analysis
captures the statistical properties of the naive repertoire, first after its
initial generation via VDJ recombination and then after selection for
functionality. We also infer statistical properties of the somatic
hypermutation machinery (exclusive of subsequent effects of selection). Our
main results are the following: the B-cell repertoire is substantially more
diverse than T-cell repertoires, due to longer junctional insertions; sequences
that pass initial selection are distinguished by having a higher probability of
being generated in a VDJ recombination event; somatic hypermutations have a
non-uniform distribution along the V gene that is well explained by an
independent site model for the sequence context around the hypermutation site.

    <title>Approximating the Minimum Breakpoint Linearization Problem for Genetic
  Maps without Gene Strandedness</title>
    <summary>  The study of genetic map linearization leads to a combinatorial hard problem,
called the {\em minimum breakpoint linearization} (MBL) problem. It is aimed at
finding a linearization of a partial order which attains the minimum breakpoint
distance to a reference total order. The approximation algorithms previously
developed for the MBL problem are only applicable to genetic maps in which
genes or markers are represented as signed integers. However, current genetic
mapping techniques generally do not specify gene strandedness so that genes can
only be represented as unsigned integers. In this paper, we study the MBL
problem in the latter more realistic case. An approximation algorithm is thus
developed, which achieves a ratio of $(m^2+2m-1)$ and runs in $O(n^7)$ time,
where $m$ is the number of genetic maps used to construct the input partial
order and $n$ the total number of distinct genes in these maps.

    <title>An Event-Driven Approach for Studying Gene Block Evolution in Bacteria</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Gene blocks are genes co-located on the chromosome. In many
cases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as
operons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:
gene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently
observed. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the
formation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been
proposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of
gene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene
block evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for
tracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the
evolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of
events. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes
out of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the
event-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the
evolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation. We
conclude that the event-based method can be used to help us understand the
formation of these important bacterial genomic structures. Availability: The

    <title>Chromosome-scale shotgun assembly using an in vitro method for
  long-range linkage</title>
    <summary>  Long-range and highly accurate de novo assembly from short-read data is one
of the most pressing challenges in genomics. Recently, it has been shown that
read pairs generated by proximity ligation of DNA in chromatin of living tissue
can address this problem. These data dramatically increase the scaffold
contiguity of assemblies and provide haplotype phasing information. Here, we
describe a simpler approach ("Chicago") based on in vitro reconstituted
chromatin. We generated two Chicago datasets with human DNA and used a new
software pipeline ("HiRise") to construct a highly accurate de novo assembly
and scaffolding of a human genome with scaffold N50 of 30 Mb. We also
demonstrated the utility of Chicago for improving existing assemblies by
re-assembling and scaffolding the genome of the American alligator. With a
single library and one lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we increased the
scaffold N50 of the American alligator from 508 kb to 10 Mb. Our method uses
established molecular biology procedures and can be used to analyze any genome,
as it requires only about 5 micrograms of DNA as the starting material.

    <title>AMAS: optimizing the partition and filtration of adaptive seeds to speed
  up read mapping</title>
    <summary>  Background: Identifying all possible mapping locations of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) reads is highly essential in several applications such as
prediction of genomic variants or protein binding motifs located in repeat
regions, isoform expression quantification, metagenomics analysis, etc.
However, this task is very time-consuming and majority of mapping tools only
focus on one or a few best mapping locations. Results: We propose AMAS, an
alignment tool specialized in identifying all possible mapping locations of NGS
reads in a reference sequence. AMAS features an effective use of adaptive seeds
to speed up read mapping while preserving sensitivity. Specifically, an index
is designed to pre-store the locations of adaptive seeds in the reference
sequence, efficiently reducing the time for seed matching and partitioning. An
accurate filtration of adaptive seeds is further applied to substantially
tighten the candidate alignment space. As a result, AMAS runs several times
faster than other state-of-the-art read mappers while achieving similar
accuracy. Conclusions: AMAS provides a valuable resource to speed up the
important yet time-consuming task of identifying all mapping locations of NGS
reads. AMAS is implemented in C++ based on the SeqAn library and is freely
available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngsamas/. Keywords:

    <title>Whole Genome Sequencing: Innovation Dream or Privacy Nightmare?</title>
    <summary>  Over the past several years, DNA sequencing has emerged as one of the driving
forces in life-sciences, paving the way for affordable and accurate whole
genome sequencing. As genomes represent the entirety of an organism's
hereditary information, the availability of complete human genomes prompts a
wide range of revolutionary applications. The hope for improving modern
healthcare and better understanding the human genome propels many interesting
and challenging research frontiers. Unfortunately, however, the proliferation
of human genomes amplifies worrisome privacy concerns, since a genome
represents a treasure trove of highly personal and sensitive information. In
this article, we provide an overview of positive results and biomedical
advances in the field, and discuss privacy issues associated with human genomic
information. Finally, we survey available privacy-enhancing technologies and
list a number of open research challenges.

    <title>Sparse and compositionally robust inference of microbial ecological
  networks</title>
    <summary>  16S-ribosomal sequencing and other metagonomic techniques provide snapshots
of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial
populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community
structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions,
identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as
these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of
microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 16S datasets are
compositional, and thus, microbial abundances are not independent. Secondly,
microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only
tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU interaction networks is
severely under-powered, and additional assumptions are required for accurate
inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation
for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference
of microbial ecological interactions from metagenomic datasets that addresses
both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for
compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that
assumes the underlying ecological interaction network is sparse. To reconstruct
the interaction network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse
neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. Because no large-scale microbial
ecological networks have been experimentally validated, SPIEC-EASI comprises
computational tools to generate realistic OTU count data from a set of diverse
underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of edge recovery and network properties on realistic synthetic data
under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously
unknown microbial interactions using data from the American Gut project.

    <title>Indexing arbitrary-length $k$-mers in sequencing reads</title>
    <summary>  We propose a lightweight data structure for indexing and querying collections
of NGS reads data in main memory. The data structure supports the interface
proposed in the pioneering work by Philippe et al. for counting and locating
$k$-mers in sequencing reads. Our solution, PgSA (pseudogenome suffix array),
based on finding overlapping reads, is competitive to the existing algorithms
in the space use, query times, or both. The main applications of our index
include variant calling, error correction and analysis of reads from RNA-seq
experiments.

    <title>Correcting Illumina sequencing errors for human data</title>
    <summary>  Summary: We present a new tool to correct sequencing errors in Illumina data
produced from high-coverage whole-genome shotgun resequencing. It uses a
non-greedy algorithm and shows comparable performance and higher accuracy in an
evaluation on real human data. This evaluation has the most complete collection
of high-performance error correctors so far.

    <title>Of Protein Size and Genomes</title>
    <summary>  An approach for approximately calculating the number of genes in a genome is
presented, which takes into account the average protein length expected for the
species. A number of virus, bacterial and eukaryotic genomes are scrutinized.
Genome figures are presented, which support the average protein size of a
species as a criterion for assessing life complexity. The human gene
distribution in the 23 chromosomes is investigated emphasizing the genomic
rate, the mean 'exon' length, and the mean 'exons per gene'. It is shown that
storing all genes of a single human definitely requires less than 12 MB.

    <title>Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of copper stress acclimation in
  Ectocarpus siliculosus highlights signaling and tolerance mechanisms in brown
  algae</title>
    <summary>  Brown algae are sessile macro-organisms of great ecological relevance in
coastal ecosystems. They evolved independently from land plants and other
multicellular lineages, and therefore hold several original ontogenic and
metabolic features. Most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they
face frequent environmental changes, including exposure to toxic levels of
heavy metals such as copper (Cu). We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and
metabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal
model E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for
other abiotic stressors. This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative
stress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between
Cu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the
activation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,
together with the regulation of genes coding for several
transcription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically
activated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type
ATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent
bromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally
we observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic
processes on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen
assimilation on the other hand. Comparisons with data from green plants
indicate that some processes involved in Cu and oxidative stress response are
conserved across these two distant lineages. At the same time the high number
of yet uncharacterized brown alga-specific genes induced in response to copper
stress underlines the potential to discover new components and molecular
interactions unique to these organisms. Of particular interest for future
research is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-,
myo-inositol-, and oxylipin signaling.

    <title>Optimal Haplotype Assembly from High-Throughput Mate-Pair Reads</title>
    <summary>  Humans have $23$ pairs of homologous chromosomes. The homologous pairs are
almost identical pairs of chromosomes. For the most part, differences in
homologous chromosome occur at certain documented positions called single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A haplotype of an individual is the pair of
sequences of SNPs on the two homologous chromosomes. In this paper, we study
the problem of inferring haplotypes of individuals from mate-pair reads of
their genome. We give a simple formula for the coverage needed for haplotype
assembly, under a generative model. The analysis here leverages connections of
this problem with decoding convolutional codes.

    <title>TREEOME: A framework for epigenetic and transcriptomic data integration
  to explore regulatory interactions controlling transcription</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Predictive modelling of gene expression is a powerful framework
for the in silico exploration of transcriptional regulatory interactions
through the integration of high-throughput -omics data. A major limitation of
previous approaches is their inability to handle conditional and synergistic
interactions that emerge when collectively analysing genes subject to different
regulatory mechanisms. This limitation reduces overall predictive power and
thus the reliability of downstream biological inference.
  Results: We introduce an analytical modelling framework (TREEOME: tree of
models of expression) that integrates epigenetic and transcriptomic data by
separating genes into putative regulatory classes. Current predictive modelling
approaches have found both DNA methylation and histone modification epigenetic
data to provide little or no improvement in accuracy of prediction of
transcript abundance despite, for example, distinct anti-correlation between
mRNA levels and promoter-localised DNA methylation. To improve on this, in
TREEOME we evaluate four possible methods of formulating gene-level DNA
methylation metrics, which provide a foundation for identifying gene-level
methylation events and subsequent differential analysis, whereas most previous
techniques operate at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides. We demonstrate
TREEOME by integrating gene-level DNA methylation (bisulfite-seq) and histone
modification (ChIP-seq) data to accurately predict genome-wide mRNA transcript
abundance (RNA-seq) for H1-hESC and GM12878 cell lines.
  Availability: TREEOME is implemented using open-source software and made
available as a pre-configured bootable reference environment. All scripts and
data presented in this study are available online at

    <title>DeDaL: Cytoscape 3.0 app for producing and morphing data-driven and
  structure-driven network layouts</title>
    <summary>  Visualization and analysis of molecular profiling data together with
biological networks are able to provide new mechanistical insights into
biological functions. Currently, high-throughput data are usually visualized on
top of predefined network layouts which are not always adapted to a given data
analysis task. We developed a Cytoscape app which allows to construct
biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported
as values of nodes attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3.0 app which uses linear
and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network
layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL
implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as
continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one
network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. Combining
these possibilities facilitates creating insightful network layouts
representing both structural network features and the correlation patterns in
multivariate data. DeDaL is the first method allowing to construct biological
network layouts from high-throughput data. DeDaL is freely available for
downloading together with step-by-step tutorial at
http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/dedal/.

    <title>A Computational Method for the Rate Estimation of Evolutionary
  Transpositions</title>
    <summary>  Genome rearrangements are evolutionary events that shuffle genomic
architectures. Most frequent genome rearrangements are reversals,
translocations, fusions, and fissions. While there are some more complex genome
rearrangements such as transpositions, they are rarely observed and believed to
constitute only a small fraction of genome rearrangements happening in the
course of evolution. The analysis of transpositions is further obfuscated by
intractability of the underlying computational problems.
  We propose a computational method for estimating the rate of transpositions
in evolutionary scenarios between genomes. We applied our method to a set of
mammalian genomes and estimated the transpositions rate in mammalian evolution
to be around 0.26.

    <title>Interpreting 16S metagenomic data without clustering to achieve sub-OTU
  resolution</title>
    <summary>  The standard approach to analyzing 16S tag sequence data, which relies on
clustering reads by sequence similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs), underexploits the accuracy of modern sequencing technology. We present
a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina datasets that can identify
independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S
tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of
human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97% similarity
OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S
tags differing by as little as 1 nucleotide (99.2% similarity). A comparative
analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most
such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100% sequence
identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is
strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in
the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in
cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We
discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into
factors shaping community assembly.

    <title>Fast Approximate Inference of Transcript Expression Levels from RNA-seq
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The mapping of RNA-seq reads to their transcripts of origin is a
fundamental task in transcript expression estimation and differential
expression scoring. Where ambiguities in mapping exist due to transcripts
sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or alleles, the problem becomes an
instance of non-trivial probabilistic inference. Bayesian inference in such a
problem is intractable and approximate methods must be used such as Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Bayes. Standard implementations of
these methods can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex gene
models.
  Results: We propose an approximate inference scheme based on Variational
Bayes applied to an existing model of transcript expression inference from
RNA-seq data. We apply recent advances in Variational Bayes algorithmics to
improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard variational
expectation-maximisation approach. We apply our algorithm to simulated and
biological datasets, demonstrating that the increase in speed requires only a
small trade-off in accuracy of expression level estimation.
  Availability: The methods were implemented in R and C++, and are available as
part of the BitSeq project at https://code.google.com/p/bitseq/. The methods
will be made available through the BitSeq Bioconductor package at the next
stable release.

    <title>Do Read Errors Matter for Genome Assembly?</title>
    <summary>  While most current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies generate short
reads with low error rates, emerging sequencing technologies generate long
reads with high error rates. A basic question of interest is the tradeoff
between read length and error rate in terms of the information needed for the
perfect assembly of the genome. Using an adversarial erasure error model, we
make progress on this problem by establishing a critical read length, as a
function of the genome and the error rate, above which perfect assembly is
guaranteed. For several real genomes, including those from the GAGE dataset, we
verify that this critical read length is not significantly greater than the
read length required for perfect assembly from reads without errors.

    <title>Rapid Sequence Identification of Potential Pathogens Using Techniques
  from Sparse Linear Algebra</title>
    <summary>  The decreasing costs and increasing speed and accuracy of DNA sample
collection, preparation, and sequencing has rapidly produced an enormous volume
of genetic data. However, fast and accurate analysis of the samples remains a
bottleneck. Here we present D$^{4}$RAGenS, a genetic sequence identification
algorithm that exhibits the Big Data handling and computational power of the
Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M). The method leverages linear
algebra and statistical properties to increase computational performance while
retaining accuracy by subsampling the data. Two run modes, Fast and Wise, yield
speed and precision tradeoffs, with applications in biodefense and medical
diagnostics. The D$^{4}$RAGenS analysis algorithm is tested over several
datasets, including three utilized for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency
(DTRA) metagenomic algorithm contest.

    <title>Integrating alignment-based and alignment-free sequence similarity
  measures for biological sequence classification</title>
    <summary>  Alignment-based sequence similarity searches, while accurate for some type of
sequences, can produce incorrect results when used on more divergent but
functionally related sequences that have undergone the sequence rearrangements
observed in many bacterial and viral genomes. Here, we propose a classification
model that exploits the complementary nature of alignment-based and
alignment-free similarity measures with the aim to improve the accuracy with
which DNA and protein sequences are characterized. Our model classifies
sequences using a combined sequence similarity score calculated by adaptively
weighting the contribution of different sequence similarity measures. Weights
are determined independently for each sequence in the test set and reflect the
discriminatory ability of individual similarity measures in the training set.
Since the similarity between some sequences is determined more accurately with
one type of measure rather than another, our classifier allows different sets
of weights to be associated with different sequences. Using five different
similarity measures we show that our model significantly improves the
classification accuracy over the current composition and alignment based
models, when predicting the taxonomic lineage for both short viral sequence
fragments and complete viral sequences. We also show that our model can be used
effectively for the classification of reads from a real metagenome dataset as
well as protein sequences.

    <title>Retrotransposon mobilization in cancer genomes</title>
    <summary>  The Cancer Genome Atlas project was initiated by the National Cancer
Institute in order to characterize the genomes of hundreds of tumors of various
cancer types. While much effort has been put into detecting somatic genomic
variation in these data, somatic structural variation induced by the activity
of transposable element insertions has not been reported. Transposable elements
(TEs) are particularly relevant in cancer in part because of several known
cases in which a TE insertion is directly linked to cancer formation and
studies linking the epigenetic status of retrotransposons to carcinogenesis and
patient outcome. Additionally, evidence for somatic retrotransposition in
eukaryotic genomes suggests that some tissues and therefore some cancer types
may be disposed to increased retrotransposition. We built upon previous work to
develop a highly efficient computational pipeline for the detection of
non-reference mobile ele- ment insertions from high-throughput paired-end whole
genome sequencing data that is capable of detecting breakpoints through a local
assembly strategy. Using this, we analyzed 33 whole genome tumor datasets with
paired normal samples from TCGA across 3 different cancer types: glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) and colorectal ade-
nocarcinoma (COAD). We detected 72 insertions in colon samples, almost all of
them LINE-1 elements, and none in GBM or OV. The amount of somatic
retrotransposition varies widely between samples with 61 insertions present in
one case. The lack of somatic retrotransposon insertions in GBM and OV samples
suggests that TE activity in cancer is restricted to certain cancer types.

    <title>A Simple Data-Adaptive Probabilistic Variant Calling Model</title>
    <summary>  Background: Several sources of noise obfuscate the identification of single
nucleotide variation (SNV) in next generation sequencing data. For instance,
errors may be introduced during library construction and sequencing steps. In
addition, the reference genome and the algorithms used for the alignment of the
reads are further critical factors determining the efficacy of variant calling
methods. It is crucial to account for these factors in individual sequencing
experiments.
  Results: We introduce a simple data-adaptive model for variant calling. This
model automatically adjusts to specific factors such as alignment errors. To
achieve this, several characteristics are sampled from sites with low mismatch
rates, and these are used to estimate empirical log-likelihoods. These
likelihoods are then combined to a score that typically gives rise to a mixture
distribution. From these we determine a decision threshold to separate
potentially variant sites from the noisy background.
  Conclusions: In simulations we show that our simple proposed model is
competitive with frequently used much more complex SNV calling algorithms in
terms of sensitivity and specificity. It performs specifically well in cases
with low allele frequencies. The application to next-generation sequencing data
reveals stark differences of the score distributions indicating a strong
influence of data specific sources of noise. The proposed model is specifically
designed to adjust to these differences.

    <title>Comparison between the amount of environmental change and the amount of
  transcriptome change</title>
    <summary>  Cells must coordinate adjustments in genome expression to accommodate changes
in their environment. We hypothesized that the amount of transcriptome change
is proportional to the amount of environmental change. To capture the effects
of environmental changes on the transcriptome, we compared transcriptome
diversities (defined as the Shannon entropy of frequency distribution) of
silkworm fat-body tissues cultured with several concentrations of
phenobarbital. Although there was no proportional relationship, we did identify
a drug concentration tipping point between 0.25 and 1.0 mM. Cells cultured in
media containing lower drug concentrations than the tipping point showed
uniformly high transcriptome diversities, while those cultured at higher drug
concentrations than the tipping point showed uniformly low transcriptome
diversities. The plasticity of transcriptome diversity was corroborated by
cultivations of fat bodies in MGM-450 insect medium without phenobarbital and
in 0.25 mM phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium after previous
cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450 insect medium without
phenobarbital, followed by cultivation for 10 hours in 1.0 mM
phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium). Interestingly, the
transcriptome diversities of cells cultured in media containing 0.25 mM
phenobarbital after previous cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450
insect medium without phenobarbital, followed by cultivation for 10 hours in
1.0 mM phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium) were different from
cells cultured in media containing 0.25 mM phenobarbital after previous
cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450 insect medium without
phenobarbital). This hysteretic phenomenon of transcriptome diversities
indicates multi-stability of the genome expression system.

    <title>The mathematics of the genetic code reveal that frequency degeneracy
  leads to exponential scaling in the DNA codon distribution of Homo sapiens</title>
    <summary>  The nature of the quantitative distribution of the 64 DNA codons in the human
genome has been an issue of debate for over a decade. Some groups have proposed
that the quantitative distribution of the DNA codons ordered as a
rank-frequency plot follows a well-known power law called Zipf's law. Others
have shown that the DNA codon distribution is best fitted to an exponential
function. However, the reason for such scaling behavior has not yet been
addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity of the
DNA codon distribution is a direct consequence of the frequency recurrence of
the codon usage (i.e., the repetitiveness of codon usage frequencies at the
whole genome level). We discover that if frequency recurrence is absent from
the human genome, the frequency of occurrence of codons scales linearly with
the codon rank. We also show that DNA codons of both low and high frequency of
occurrence in the genome are best fitted by an exponential function and provide
strong evidence to suggest that the coding region of the human genome does not
follow Zipf's law. Information-theoretic methods and entropy calculations are
applied to the DNA codon distribution and a new approach, called the lariat
method, is proposed to quantitatively analyze the DNA codon distribution in
Homo sapiens.

    <title>On The Organization Of Human T Cell Receptor Loci</title>
    <summary>  The human T cell repertoire is generated by the rearrangement of variable
(V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments on the T cell receptor (TCR) loci.
To determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR
loci contributes to the observed clonal frequencies, the TCR loci were examined
for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of gene segment organization.
Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V
and J gene segments for both T cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) loci
were arranged in a self-similar manner when the spacing between adjacent
segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene
segment. The ratio of genomic distance between either the J (in TRA) or D (in
TRB) segments and successive V segments on these loci declined logarithmically.
Accounting for the gene segments occurring on helical DNA molecules, in a
logarithmic distribution, sine and cosine functions of the log transformed
angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene
segments showed an ordered progression across the locus, supporting a
log-periodic organization. T cell clonal frequencies, based on V and J segment
usage, from three normal stem cell donors plotted against the respective
segment locations on TRB locus demonstrated a periodic variation. We
hypothesize that this quasi-periodic variation in T cell clonal repertoire may
be influenced by the location of the gene segments on the logarithmically
scaled TCR loci. Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double
helix may influence the probability of gene segment usage by means of either
constructive or destructive interference resulting from the superposition of
the two helices, impacting probability of DNA recombination.

    <title>Microbial community pattern detection in human body habitats via
  ensemble clustering framework</title>
    <summary>  The human habitat is a host where microbial species evolve, function, and
continue to evolve. Elucidating how microbial communities respond to human
habitats is a fundamental and critical task, as establishing baselines of human
microbiome is essential in understanding its role in human disease and health.
However, current studies usually overlook a complex and interconnected
landscape of human microbiome and limit the ability in particular body habitats
with learning models of specific criterion. Therefore, these methods could not
capture the real-world underlying microbial patterns effectively. To obtain a
comprehensive view, we propose a novel ensemble clustering framework to mine
the structure of microbial community pattern on large-scale metagenomic data.
Particularly, we first build a microbial similarity network via integrating
1920 metagenomic samples from three body habitats of healthy adults. Then a
novel symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based ensemble model is
proposed and applied onto the network to detect clustering pattern. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on
deriving microbial community with respect to body habitat and host gender. From
clustering results, we observed that body habitat exhibits a strong bound but
non-unique microbial structural patterns. Meanwhile, human microbiome reveals
different degree of structural variations over body habitat and host gender. In
summary, our ensemble clustering framework could efficiently explore integrated
clustering results to accurately identify microbial communities, and provide a
comprehensive view for a set of microbial communities. Such trends depict an
integrated biography of microbial communities, which offer a new insight
towards uncovering pathogenic model of human microbiome.

    <title>Fast and Scalable Inference of Multi-Sample Cancer Lineages</title>
    <summary>  Somatic variants can be used as lineage markers for the phylogenetic
reconstruction of cancer evolution. Since somatic phylogenetics is complicated
by sample heterogeneity, novel specialized tree-building methods are required
for cancer phylogeny reconstruction. We present LICHeE (Lineage Inference for
Cancer Heterogeneity and Evolution), a novel method that automates the
phylogenetic inference of cancer progression from multiple somatic samples.
LICHeE uses variant allele frequencies of SSNVs obtained by deep sequencing to
reconstruct multi-sample cell lineage trees and infer the subclonal composition
of the samples. LICHeE is open-sourced and available at
http://viq854.github.io/lichee.

    <title>MEGAHIT: An ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex
  metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph</title>
    <summary>  MEGAHIT is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling large and complex
metagenomics data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. It finished assembling
a soil metagenomics dataset with 252Gbps in 44.1 hours and 99.6 hours on a
single computing node with and without a GPU, respectively. MEGAHIT assembles
the data as a whole, i.e., it avoids pre-processing like partitioning and
normalization, which might compromise on result integrity. MEGAHIT generates 3
times larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length than
the previous assembly. 55.8% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, which
is 4 times higher than the previous. The source code of MEGAHIT is freely
available at https://github.com/voutcn/megahit under GPLv3 license.

    <title>Fast Genome-Wide QTL Association Mapping on Pedigree and Population Data</title>
    <summary>  Since most analysis software for genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
currently exploit only unrelated individuals, there is a need for efficient
applications that can handle general pedigree data or mixtures of both
population and pedigree data. Even data sets thought to consist of only
unrelated individuals may include cryptic relationships that can lead to false
positives if not discovered and controlled for. In addition, family designs
possess compelling advantages. They are better equipped to detect rare
variants, control for population stratification, and facilitate the study of
parent-of-origin effects. Pedigrees selected for extreme trait values often
segregate a single gene with strong effect. Finally, many pedigrees are
available as an important legacy from the era of linkage analysis.
Unfortunately, pedigree likelihoods are notoriously hard to compute. In this
paper we re-examine the computational bottlenecks and implement ultra-fast
pedigree-based GWAS analysis. Kinship coefficients can either be based on
explicitly provided pedigrees or automatically estimated from dense markers.
Our strategy (a) works for random sample data, pedigree data, or a mix of both;
(b) entails no loss of power; (c) allows for any number of covariate
adjustments, including correction for population stratification; (d) allows for
testing SNPs under additive, dominant, and recessive models; and (e)
accommodates both univariate and multivariate quantitative traits. On a typical
personal computer (6 CPU cores at 2.67 GHz), analyzing a univariate HDL
(high-density lipoprotein) trait from the San Antonio Family Heart Study
(935,392 SNPs on 1357 individuals in 124 pedigrees) takes less than 2 minutes
and 1.5 GB of memory. Complete multivariate QTL analysis of the three
time-points of the longitudinal HDL multivariate trait takes less than 5
minutes and 1.5 GB of memory.

    <title>Disorder and Power-law Tails of DNA Sequence Self-Alignment
  Concentrations in Molecular Evolution</title>
    <summary>  The self-alignment concentrations, $c(x)$, as functions of the length, $x$,
of the identically matching maximal segments in the genomes of a variety of
species, typically present power-law tails extending to the largest scales,
i.e., $c(x) \propto x^{\alpha}$, with similar or apparently different negative
$\alpha$s ($&lt;-2$). The relevant fundamental processes of molecular evolution
are segmental duplication and point mutation, and that recently the stick
fragmentation phenomenology has been used to account the neutral evolution.
However, disorder is intrinsic to the evolution system and, by freezing it in
time (quenching) for the setup of a simple fragmentation model, we obtain
decaying, steady-state and the general full time-dependent solutions, all
$\propto x^{\alpha}$ for $x\to \infty$, which is in contrast to the only
power-law solution, $x^{-3}$ for $x\to 0$ of the pure model (without disorder).
%Other algebraic terms may dominate at intermediate scales, which seems to be
confirmed by some species, such as rice. We also present self-alignment results
showing more than one scaling regimes, consistent with the theoretical results
of the existence of more than one algebraic terms which dominate at different
regimes.

    <title>A perceptual hash function to store and retrieve large scale DNA
  sequences</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a novel approach for storing and retrieving massive DNA
sequences.. The method is based on a perceptual hash function, commonly used to
determine the similarity between digital images, that we adapted for DNA
sequences. Perceptual hash function presented here is based on a Discrete
Cosine Transform Sign Only (DCT-SO). Each nucleotide is encoded as a fixed gray
level intensity pixel and the hash is calculated from its significant frequency
characteristics. This results to a drastic data reduction between the sequence
and the perceptual hash. Unlike cryptographic hash functions, perceptual hashes
are not affected by "avalanche effect" and thus can be compared. The similarity
distance between two hashes is estimated with the Hamming Distance, which is
used to retrieve DNA sequences. Experiments that we conducted show that our
approach is relevant for storing massive DNA sequences, and retrieving them.

    <title>Gene Similarity-based Approaches for Determining Core-Genes of
  Chloroplasts</title>
    <summary>  In computational biology and bioinformatics, the manner to understand
evolution processes within various related organisms paid a lot of attention
these last decades. However, accurate methodologies are still needed to
discover genes content evolution. In a previous work, two novel approaches
based on sequence similarities and genes features have been proposed. More
precisely, we proposed to use genes names, sequence similarities, or both,
insured either from NCBI or from DOGMA annotation tools. Dogma has the
advantage to be an up-to-date accurate automatic tool specifically designed for
chloroplasts, whereas NCBI possesses high quality human curated genes (together
with wrongly annotated ones). The key idea of the former proposal was to take
the best from these two tools. However, the first proposal was limited by name
variations and spelling errors on the NCBI side, leading to core trees of low
quality. In this paper, these flaws are fixed by improving the comparison of
NCBI and DOGMA results, and by relaxing constraints on gene names while adding
a stage of post-validation on gene sequences. The two stages of similarity
measures, on names and sequences, are thus proposed for sequence clustering.
This improves results that can be obtained using either NCBI or DOGMA alone.
Results obtained with this quality control test are further investigated and
compared with previously released ones, on both computational and biological
aspects, considering a set of 99 chloroplastic genomes.

    <title>Feline coronaviruses associated with feline infectious peritonitis have
  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions</title>
    <summary>  Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the
feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical
feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive
infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell
tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP
progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have
shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation
site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike
(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and
to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our
larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2
are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease
cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the
viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across
the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or
altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for
virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of
non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.
These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its
ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.

    <title>Functional Splicing Network Reveals Extensive Regulatory Potential of
  the Core Spliceosomal Machinery</title>
    <summary>  Pre-mRNA splicing relies on the poorly understood dynamic interplay between
&gt;150 protein components of the spliceosome. The steps at which splicing can be
regulated remain largely unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of
knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing
events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and used this information
to reconstruct a network of functional interactions. The network accurately
captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones,
revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components,
related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome
assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of
splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the
spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds light on the
antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can
be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.

    <title>Taxonomic Provenance: Two Influential Primate Classifications Logically
  Aligned</title>
    <summary>  Classification standards such as the Mammal Species of the World (MSW) aim to
unify name usages at the global scale, but may nevertheless experience
significant levels of taxonomic change from one edition to the next. This
circumstance challenges the biodiversity and phylogenetic data communities to
develop more granular identifiers to track taxonomic congruence and
incongruence in ways that both humans and machines can process, i.e., to
logically represent taxonomic provenance across multiple classification
hierarchies. Here we show that reasoning over taxonomic provenance is feasible
for two classifications of primates corresponding to the second and third MSW
editions. Our approach entails three main components: (1) individuation of name
usages as taxonomic concepts, (2) articulation of concepts via human-asserted
Region Connection Calculus (RCC-5) relationships, and (3) the use of an Answer
Set Programming toolkit to infer and visualize logically consistent alignments
of these taxonomic input constraints. Our use case entails the Primates sec.
Groves (1993; MSW2 - 317 taxonomic concepts; 233 at the species level) and
Primates sec. Groves (2005; MSW3 - 483 taxonomic concepts; 376 at the species
level). Using 402 concept-to-concept input articulations, the reasoning process
yields a single, consistent alignment, and infers 153,111 Maximally Informative
Relations that constitute a comprehensive provenance resolution map for every
concept pair in the Primates sec. MSW2/MSW3. The entire alignment and various
partitions facilitate quantitative analyses of name/meaning dissociation,
revealing that approximately one in three paired name usages across treatments
is not reliable - in the sense of the same name identifying congruent taxonomic
meanings. We conclude with an optimistic outlook for logic-based provenance
tools in next-generation biodiversity and phylogeny data platforms.

    <title>Multi-species network inference improves gene regulatory network
  reconstruction for early embryonic development in Drosophila</title>
    <summary>  Gene regulatory network inference uses genome-wide transcriptome measurements
in response to genetic, environmental or dynamic perturbations to predict
causal regulatory influences between genes. We hypothesized that evolution also
acts as a suitable network perturbation and that integration of data from
multiple closely related species can lead to improved reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks. To test this hypothesis, we predicted networks from
temporal gene expression data for 3,610 genes measured during early embryonic
development in six Drosophila species and compared predicted networks to gold
standard networks of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq interactions for developmental
transcription factors in five species. We found that (i) the performance of
single-species networks was independent of the species where the gold standard
was measured; (ii) differences between predicted networks reflected the known
phylogeny and differences in biology between the species; (iii) an integrative
consensus network which minimized the total number of edge gains and losses
with respect to all single-species networks performed better than any
individual network. Our results show that in an evolutionarily conserved
system, integration of data from comparable experiments in multiple species
improves the inference of gene regulatory networks. They provide a basis for
future studies on the numerous multi-species gene expression datasets for other
biological processes available in the literature.

    <title>Estimation of the methylation pattern distribution from deep sequencing
  data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Bisulphite sequencing enables the detection of cytosine
methylation. The sequence of the methylation states of cytosines on any given
read forms a methylation pattern that carries substantially more information
than merely studying the average methylation level at individual positions. In
order to understand better the complexity of DNA methylation landscapes in
biological samples, it is important to study the diversity of these methylation
patterns. However, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is
subject to sequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite
conversion of cytosines. Results: A statistical model is developed which
accounts for the distribution of DNA methylation patterns at any given locus.
The model incorporates the effects of sequencing errors and spurious reads, and
enables estimation of the true underlying distribution of methylation patterns.
Conclusions: Calculation of the estimated distribution over methylation
patterns is implemented in the R Bioconductor package MPFE. Source code and
documentation of the package are also available for download at
http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.0/bioc/html/MPFE.html.

    <title>Combined collapse by bridging and self-adhesion in a prototypical
  polymer model inspired by the bacterial nucleoid</title>
    <summary>  Recent experimental results suggest that the E. coli chromosome feels a
self-attracting interaction of osmotic origin, and is condensed in foci by
bridging interactions. Motivated by these findings, we explore a generic
modeling framework combining solely these two ingredients, in order to
characterize their joint effects. Specifically, we study a simple polymer
physics computational model with weak ubiquitous short-ranged self attraction
and stronger sparse bridging interactions. Combining theoretical arguments and
simulations, we study the general phenomenology of polymer collapse induced by
these dual contributions, in the case of regularly-spaced bridging. Our results
distinguish a regime of classical Flory-like coil-globule collapse dictated by
the interplay of excluded volume and attractive energy and a switch-like
collapse where bridging interaction compete with entropy loss terms from the
looped arms of a star-like rosette. Additionally, we show that bridging can
induce stable compartmentalized domains. In these configurations, different
"cores" of bridging proteins are kept separated by star-like polymer loops in
an entropically favorable multi-domain configuration, with a mechanism that
parallels micellar polysoaps. Such compartmentalized domains are stable, and do
not need any intra-specific interactions driving their segregation. Domains can
be stable also in presence of uniform attraction, as long as the uniform
collapse is above its theta point.

    <title>Dynamic Model for RNA-seq Data Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The newly developed deep-sequencing technologies make it possible to acquire
both quantitative and qualitative information regarding transcript biology. By
measuring messenger RNA levels for all genes in a sample, RNA-seq provides an
attractive option to characterize the global changes in transcription. RNA-seq
is becoming the widely used platform for gene expression profiling. However,
real transcription signals in the RNA-seq data are confounded with measurement
and sequencing errors, and other random biological/technical variation. How to
appropriately take the variability due to errors and sequencing technology
variation into account is essential issue in the RNA-seq data analysis. To
extract biologically useful transcription process from the RNA-seq data, we
propose to use the second ODE for modeling the RNA-seq data. We use
differential principal analysis to develop statistical methods for estimation
of location-varying coefficients of the ODE. We validate the accuracy of the
ODE model to fit the RNA-seq data by prediction analysis and 5 fold cross
validation. We find the accuracy of the second ODE model to predict the gene
expression level across the gene is very high and the second ODE model to fit
the RNA-seq data very well. To further evaluate the performance of the ODE
model for RNA-seq data analysis, we used the location-varying coefficients of
the second ODE as features to classify the normal and tumor cells. We
demonstrate that even using the ODE model for single gene we can achieve high
classification accuracy. We also conduct response analysis to investigate how
the transcription process respond to the perturbation of the external signals
and identify dozens of genes that are related to cancer.

    <title>Friendship and Natural Selection</title>
    <summary>  More than any other species, humans form social ties to individuals who are
neither kin nor mates, and these ties tend to be with similar people. Here, we
show that this similarity extends to genotypes. Across the whole genome,
friends' genotypes at the SNP level tend to be positively correlated
(homophilic); however, certain genotypes are negatively correlated
(heterophilic). A focused gene set analysis suggests that some of the overall
correlation can be explained by specific systems; for example, an olfactory
gene set is homophilic and an immune system gene set is heterophilic. Finally,
homophilic genotypes exhibit significantly higher measures of positive
selection, suggesting that, on average, they may yield a synergistic fitness
advantage that has been helping to drive recent human evolution.

    <title>Learning interpretable models of phenotypes from whole genome sequences
  with the Set Covering Machine</title>
    <summary>  The increased affordability of whole genome sequencing has motivated its use
for phenotypic studies. We address the problem of learning interpretable models
for discrete phenotypes from whole genomes. We propose a general approach that
relies on the Set Covering Machine and a k-mer representation of the genomes.
We show results for the problem of predicting the resistance of Pseudomonas
Aeruginosa, an important human pathogen, against 4 antibiotics. Our results
demonstrate that extremely sparse models which are biologically relevant can be
learnt using this approach.

    <title>A Gene Prediction Method Based on Statistics and Signal Processing</title>
    <summary>  Bioinformatics, as an emerging and rapidly developing interdisciplinary, has
become a promising and popular research field in 21st century. Extracting and
explaining useful biological information from huge amount of genetic data is an
urgent issue in post-genome era. In eukaryotic DNA sequences, gene consists of
exons and introns. To predict the location of exons which carry most genetic
information accurately has become one of the most essential issues in
bioinformatics. Here, we have used biological characteristics of introns to
find the candidate initial and final exon sections. Then we select candidate
exon sections by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Next, we predict exon
sections accurately based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and using
three-base periodicity of DNA sequence signals. This paper provides a gene
prediction method based on statistics and signal processing and also, the
improvement and prospect for this method in the future are discussed.

    <title>Chromatin Loops as Allosteric Modulators of Enhancer-Promoter
  Interactions</title>
    <summary>  The classic model of eukaryotic gene expression requires direct spatial
contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. Recent Chromosome
Conformation Capture (3C) studies show that enhancers and promoters are
embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer
model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping
interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can
influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show
that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a
promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A
loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a
promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that
different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs
due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation
occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic
distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects
manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show
that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter
pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This
phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a
conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site
affects the state of another site.

    <title>Rank discriminants for predicting phenotypes from RNA expression</title>
    <summary>  Statistical methods for analyzing large-scale biomolecular data are
commonplace in computational biology. A notable example is phenotype prediction
from gene expression data, for instance, detecting human cancers,
differentiating subtypes and predicting clinical outcomes. Still, clinical
applications remain scarce. One reason is that the complexity of the decision
rules that emerge from standard statistical learning impedes biological
understanding, in particular, any mechanistic interpretation. Here we explore
decision rules for binary classification utilizing only the ordering of
expression among several genes; the basic building blocks are then two-gene
expression comparisons. The simplest example, just one comparison, is the TSP
classifier, which has appeared in a variety of cancer-related discovery
studies. Decision rules based on multiple comparisons can better accommodate
class heterogeneity, and thereby increase accuracy, and might provide a link
with biological mechanism. We consider a general framework ("rank-in-context")
for designing discriminant functions, including a data-driven selection of the
number and identity of the genes in the support ("context"). We then specialize
to two examples: voting among several pairs and comparing the median expression
in two groups of genes. Comprehensive experiments assess accuracy relative to
other, more complex, methods, and reinforce earlier observations that simple
classifiers are competitive.

    <title>Misassembly Detection using Paired-End Sequence Reads and Optical
  Mapping Data</title>
    <summary>  A crucial problem in genome assembly is the discovery and correction of
misassembly errors in draft genomes. We develop a method that will enhance the
quality of draft genomes by identifying and removing misassembly errors using
paired short read sequence data and optical mapping data. We apply our method
to various assemblies of the loblolly pine and Francisella tularensis genomes.
Our results demonstrate that we detect more than 54% of extensively
misassembled contigs and more than 60% of locally misassembed contigs in an
assembly of Francisella tularensis, and between 31% and 100% of extensively
misassembled contigs and between 57% and 73% of locally misassembed contigs in
the assemblies of loblolly pine. MISSEQUEL can be downloaded at

    <title>Variable-Order de Bruijn Graphs</title>
    <summary>  The de Bruijn graph $G_K$ of a set of strings $S$ is a key data structure in
genome assembly that represents overlaps between all the $K$-length substrings
of $S$. Construction and navigation of the graph is a space and time bottleneck
in practice and the main hurdle for assembling large, eukaryote genomes. This
problem is compounded by the fact that state-of-the-art assemblers do not build
the de Bruijn graph for a single order (value of $K$) but for multiple values
of $K$. More precisely, they build $d$ de Bruijn graphs, each with a specific
order, i.e., $G_{K_1}, G_{K_2}, ..., G_{K_d}$. Although, this paradigm
increases the quality of the assembly produced, it increases the memory by a
factor of $d$ in most cases. In this paper, we show how to augment a succinct
de Bruijn graph representation by Bowe et al. (Proc. WABI, 2012) to support new
operations that let us change order on the fly, effectively representing all de
Bruijn graphs of order up to some maximum $K$ in a single data structure. Our
experiments show our variable-order de Bruijn graph only modestly increases
space usage, construction time, and navigation time compared to a single order
graph.

    <title>Analysis of correlation structures in the Synechocystis PCC6803 genome</title>
    <summary>  Transfer of nucleotide strings in the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome is
investigated to exhibit periodic and non-periodic correlation structures by
using the recurrence plot method and the phase space reconstruction technique.
The periodic correlation structures are generated by periodic transfer of
several substrings in long periodic or non-periodic nucleotide strings embedded
in the coding regions of genes. The non-periodic correlation structures are
generated by non-periodic transfer of several substrings covering or
overlapping with the coding regions of genes. In the periodic and non-periodic
transfer, some gaps divide the long nucleotide strings into the substrings and
prevent their global transfer. Most of the gaps are either the replacement of
one base or the insertion/reduction of one base. In the reconstructed phase
space, the points generated from two or three steps for the continuous
iterative transfer via the second maximal distance can be fitted by two lines.
It partly reveals an intrinsic dynamics in the transfer of nucleotide strings.
Due to the comparison of the relative positions and lengths, the substrings
concerned with the non-periodic correlation structures are almost identical to
the mobile elements annotated in the genome. The mobile elements are thus
endowed with the basic results on the correlation structures.

    <title>Detecting Differential Expression from RNA-seq Data with Expression
  Measurement Uncertainty</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has emerged as a revolutionary and
powerful technology for expression profiling. Most proposed methods for
detecting differentially expressed (DE) genes from RNA-seq are based on
statistics that compare normalized read counts between conditions. However,
there are few methods considering the expression measurement uncertainty into
DE detection. Moreover, most methods are only capable of detecting DE genes,
and few methods are available for detecting DE isoforms. In this paper, a
Bayesian framework (BDSeq) is proposed to detect DE genes and isoforms with
consideration of expression measurement uncertainty. This expression
measurement uncertainty provides useful information which can help to improve
the performance of DE detection. Three real RAN-seq data sets are used to
evaluate the performance of BDSeq and results show that the inclusion of
expression measurement uncertainty improves accuracy in detection of DE genes
and isoforms. Finally, we develop a GamSeq-BDSeq RNA-seq analysis pipeline to
facilitate users, which is freely available at the website
http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/liux/GSBD/GamSeq-BDSeq.html.

    <title>A Composite Genome Approach to Identify Phylogenetically Informative
  Data from Next-Generation Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  We have developed a novel method to rapidly obtain homologous genomic data
for phylogenetics directly from next-generation sequencing reads without the
use of a reference genome. This software, called SISRS, avoids the time
consuming steps of de novo whole genome assembly, genome-genome alignment, and
annotation. For simulations SISRS is able to identify large numbers of loci
containing variable sites with phylogenetic signal. For genomic data from apes,
SISRS identified thousands of variable sites, from which we produced an
accurate phylogeny. Finally, we used SISRS to identify phylogenetic markers
that we used to estimate the phylogeny of placental mammals. We recovered
phylogenies from multiple datasets that were consistent with previous
conflicting estimates of the relationships among mammals. SISRS is open source
and freely available at https://github.com/rachelss/SISRS.

    <title>Differential gene co-expression networks via Bayesian biclustering
  models</title>
    <summary>  Identifying latent structure in large data matrices is essential for
exploring biological processes. Here, we consider recovering gene co-expression
networks from gene expression data, where each network encodes relationships
between genes that are locally co-regulated by shared biological mechanisms. To
do this, we develop a Bayesian statistical model for biclustering to infer
subsets of co-regulated genes whose covariation may be observed in only a
subset of the samples. Our biclustering method, BicMix, has desirable
properties, including allowing overcomplete representations of the data,
computational tractability, and jointly modeling unknown confounders and
biological signals. Compared with related biclustering methods, BicMix recovers
latent structure with higher precision across diverse simulation scenarios.
Further, we develop a method to recover gene co-expression networks from the
estimated sparse biclustering matrices. We apply BicMix to breast cancer gene
expression data and recover a gene co-expression network that is differential
across ER+ and ER- samples.

    <title>Network Methods for Pathway Analysis of Genomic Data</title>
    <summary>  Rapid advances in high-throughput technologies have led to considerable
interest in analyzing genome-scale data in the context of biological pathways,
with the goal of identifying functional systems that are involved in a given
phenotype. In the most common approaches, biological pathways are modeled as
simple sets of genes, neglecting the network of interactions comprising the
pathway and treating all genes as equally important to the pathway's function.
Recently, a number of new methods have been proposed to integrate pathway
topology in the analyses, harnessing existing knowledge and enabling more
nuanced models of complex biological systems. However, there is little guidance
available to researches choosing between these methods. In this review, we
discuss eight topology-based methods, comparing their methodological approaches
and appropriate use cases. In addition, we present the results of the
application of these methods to a curated set of ten gene expression profiling
studies using a common set of pathway annotations. We report the computational
efficiency of the methods and the consistency of the results across methods and
studies to help guide users in choosing a method. We also discuss the
challenges and future outlook for improved network analysis methodologies.

    <title>Distributions of positive signals in pyrosequencing</title>
    <summary>  Pyrosequencing is one of the important next-generation sequencing
technologies. We derive the distribution of the number of positive signals in
pyrograms of this sequencing technology as a function of flow cycle numbers and
nucleotide probabilities of the target sequences. As for the distribution of
sequence length, we also derive the distribution of positive signals for the
fixed flow cycle model. Explicit formulas are derived for the mean and variance
of the distributions. A simple result for the mean of the distribution is that
the mean number of positive signals in a pyrogram is approximately twice the
number of flow cycles, regardless of nucleotide probabilities. The statistical
distributions will be useful for instrument and software development for
pyrosequencing and other related platforms.

    <title>Statistical distributions of sequencing by synthesis with probabilistic
  nucleotide incorporation</title>
    <summary>  Sequencing by synthesis is used in many next-generation DNA sequencing
technologies. Some of the technologies, especially those exploring the
principle of single-molecule sequencing, allow incomplete nucleotide
incorporation in each cycle. We derive statistical distributions for sequencing
by synthesis by taking into account the possibility that nucleotide
incorporation may not be complete in each flow cycle. The statistical
distributions are expressed in terms of nucleotide probabilities of the target
sequences and the nucleotide incorporation probabilities for each nucleotide.
We give exact distributions both for fixed number of flow cycles and for fixed
sequence length. Explicit formulas are derived for the mean and variance of
these distributions. The results are generalizations of our previous work for
pyrosequencing. Incomplete nucleotide incorporation leads to significant change
in the mean and variance of the distributions, but still they can be
approximated by normal distributions with the same mean and variance. The
results are also generalized to handle sequence context dependent
incorporation. The statistical distributions will be useful for instrument and
software development for sequencing by synthesis platforms.

    <title>Length distribution of sequencing by synthesis: fixed flow cycle model</title>
    <summary>  Sequencing by synthesis is the underlying technology for many next-generation
DNA sequencing platforms. We developed a new model, the fixed flow cycle model,
to derive the distributions of sequence length for a given number of flow
cycles under the general conditions where the nucleotide incorporation is
probabilistic and may be incomplete, as in some single-molecule sequencing
technologies. Unlike the previous model, the new model yields the probability
distribution for the sequence length. Explicit closed form formulas are derived
for the mean and variance of the distribution.

    <title>Assembly of repetitive regions using next-generation sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  High read depth can be used to assemble short sequence repeats. The existing
genome assemblers fail in repetitive regions of longer than average read.
  I propose a new algorithm for a DNA assembly which uses the relative
frequency of reads to properly reconstruct repetitive sequences. The
mathematical model shows the upper limits of accuracy of the results as a
function of read coverage. For high coverage, the estimation error depends
linearly on repetitive sequence length and inversely proportional to the
sequencing coverage. The algorithm requires high read depth, provided by the
next-generation sequencers and could use the existing data. The tests on
errorless reads, generated in silico from several model genomes, pointed the
properly reconstructed repetitive sequences, where existing assemblers fail.

    <title>Relationship between metabolic and genomic diversity in sesame (Sesamum
  indicum L.)</title>
    <summary>  Background: Diversity estimates in cultivated plants provide a rationale for
conservation strategies and support the selection of starting material for
breeding programs. Diversity measures applied to crops usually have been
limited to the assessment of genome polymorphism at the DNA level.
Occasionally, selected morphological features are recorded and the content of
key chemical constituents determined, but unbiased and comprehensive chemical
phenotypes have not been included systematically in diversity surveys. Our
objective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by
nontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between
metabolic and genome diversity in this crop. Results: Ten sesame accessions
were selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in
India, Western Asia, Sudan and Venezuela based on previous AFLP studies.
Ethanolic seed extracts were separated by HPLC, metabolites were ionized by
positive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass
spectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000. Genome diversity was
determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) using eight primer
pair combinations. The relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at
the metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate
statistics. Conclusion: Patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic
levels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the
evolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. This result implies that when used
for the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity
assessment based on neutral DNA markers should be complemented with metabolic
profiles. We hypothesize that this applies to all crops with a long history of
domestication that possess commercially relevant traits affected by chemical
phenotypes.

    <title>Mapping eQTL networks with mixed graphical Markov models</title>
    <summary>  Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping constitutes a challenging
problem due to, among other reasons, the high-dimensional multivariate nature
of gene-expression traits. Next to the expression heterogeneity produced by
confounding factors and other sources of unwanted variation, indirect effects
spread throughout genes as a result of genetic, molecular and environmental
perturbations. From a multivariate perspective one would like to adjust for the
effect of all of these factors to end up with a network of direct associations
connecting the path from genotype to phenotype. In this paper we approach this
challenge with mixed graphical Markov models, higher-order conditional
independences and q-order correlation graphs. These models show that additive
genetic effects propagate through the network as function of gene-gene
correlations. Our estimation of the eQTL network underlying a well-studied
yeast data set leads to a sparse structure with more direct genetic and
regulatory associations that enable a straightforward comparison of the genetic
control of gene expression across chromosomes. Interestingly, it also reveals
that eQTLs explain most of the expression variability of network hub genes.

    <title>Genetic Studies of Physiological Traits with Their Application to Sleep
  Apnea</title>
    <summary>  Advances of modern sensing and sequencing technologies generate a deluge of
high dimensional space-temporal physiological and next-generation sequencing
(NGS) data. Physiological traits are observed either as continuous random
functions, or on a dense grid and referred to as function-valued traits. Both
physiological and NGS data are highly correlated data with their inherent
order, spacing, and functional nature which are ignored by traditional
summary-based univariate and multivariate regression methods designed for
quantitative genetic analysis of scalar trait and common variants. To capture
morphological and dynamic features of the data and utilize their dependent
structure, we propose a functional linear model (FLM) in which a trait curve is
modeled as a response function, the genetic variation in a genomic region or
gene is modeled as a functional predictor, and the genetic effects are modeled
as a function of both time and genomic position (FLMF) for genetic analysis of
function-valued trait with both GWAS and NGS data. By extensive simulations, we
demonstrate that the FLMF has the correct type 1 error rates and much higher
power to detect association than the existing methods. The FLMF is applied to
sleep data from Starr County health studies where oxygen saturation were
measured in 22,670 seconds on average for 833 individuals. We found 65 genes
that were significantly associated with oxygen saturation functional trait with
P-values ranging from 2.40E-06 to 2.53E-21. The results clearly demonstrate
that the FLMF substantially outperforms the traditional genetic models with
scalar trait.

    <title>M3D: a kernel-based test for shape changes in methylation profiles</title>
    <summary>  DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark implicated in many
biological processes of direct clinical relevance. While sequencing based
technologies are increasingly allowing high resolution measurements of DNA
methylation, statistical modelling of such data is still challenging. In
particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions
across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for
spatial correlations within the statistical testing procedure.
  We propose a non-parametric, kernel-based method, M3D, to detect higher-order
changes in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre-defined regions. The
test statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between
samples, thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis
of methylation data. Empirical tests on real and simulated data sets show an
increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable
robustness with respect to coverage and replication levels.
  Code is implemented in R, and is freely available via Bioconductor package
M3D.

    <title>Btrim: A fast, lightweight adapter and quality trimming program for
  next-generation sequencing technologies</title>
    <summary>  Btrim is a fast and lightweight software to trim adapters and low quality
regions in reads from ultra high-throughput next-generation sequencing
machines. It also can reliably identify barcodes and assign the reads to the
original samples. Based on a modified Myers's bit-vector dynamic programming
algorithm, Btrim can handle indels in adapters and barcodes. It removes low
quality regions and trims off adapters at both or either end of the reads. A
typical trimming of 30M reads with two sets of adapter pairs can be done in
about a minute with a small memory footprint. Btrim is a versatile stand-alone
tool that can be used as the first step in virtually all next-generation
sequence analysis pipelines. The program is available at
\url{http://graphics.med.yale.edu/trim/}.

    <title>Phylogenetic automata, pruning, and multiple alignment</title>
    <summary>  We present an extension of Felsenstein's algorithm to indel models defined on
entire sequences, without the need to condition on one multiple alignment. The
algorithm makes use of a generalization from probabilistic substitution
matrices to weighted finite-state transducers. Our approach may equivalently be
viewed as a probabilistic formulation of progressive multiple sequence
alignment, using partial-order graphs to represent ensemble profiles of
ancestral sequences. We present a hierarchical stochastic approximation
technique which makes this algorithm tractable for alignment analyses of
reasonable size.

    <title>DNA methylation variation in Arabidopsis has a genetic basis and shows
  evidence of local adaptation</title>
    <summary>  Epigenome modulation in response to the environment potentially provides a
mechanism for organisms to adapt, both within and between generations. However,
neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the molecular mechanisms involved
are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish Arabidopsis
thaliana accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects
on DNA methylation were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found
to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that the
extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic
variants in both cis and trans, including a major trans-association close to
the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body
methylation (GBM) on the coding region of genes was not affected by growth
temperature, but was instead strongly correlated with the latitude of origin.
Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant
fraction of the genome, and this was correlated with elevated transcription
levels for the genes affected. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that
this effect was largely due to trans-acting loci, a significant fraction of
which showed evidence of local adaptation. These findings constitute the first
direct link between DNA methylation and adaptation to the environment, and
provide a basis for further dissecting how environmentally driven and
genetically determined epigenetic variation interact and influence organismal
fitness.

    <title>Second-generation PLINK: rising to the challenge of larger and richer
  datasets</title>
    <summary>  PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the
steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies
has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of
key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently
contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants,
none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.
  To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for
PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces
extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic
improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4
orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit
in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data
format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and
multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the
new types of information.
  The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in
performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to
high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the
feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.

    <title>On the abundance of intrinsically disordered proteins in the human
  proteome and its relation to diseases: there is no enrichment</title>
    <summary>  Intrinsically disordered proteins are fascinating the community of protein
science since the last decade, at least. There is a well-established line of
research that intends to reveal the crucial role played by intrinsically
disordered proteins (IDPs) in the development of human diseases. The main
argument is that IDPs are differentially more present in groups of
disease-related proteins. In this note we compare the frequency of disorder in
human proteins, both disease-related and not. The frequency of disorder is
comparable in the two sub-groups of proteins. Disorder is widespread in human
proteins, but it is not a specific pre-requisite of proteins involved in the
development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurodegenerative
diseases. A tendency of cancer-related proteins to be statistically more
disordered than the rest of human proteins is confirmed.

    <title>Probe region expression estimation for RNA-seq data for improved
  microarray comparability</title>
    <summary>  Rapidly growing public gene expression databases contain a wealth of data for
building an unprecedentedly detailed picture of human biology and disease. This
data comes from many diverse measurement platforms that make integrating it all
difficult. Although RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is attracting the most attention,
at present the rate of new microarray studies submitted to public databases far
exceeds the rate of new RNA-seq studies. There is clearly a need for methods
that make it easier to combine data from different technologies. In this paper,
we propose a new method for processing RNA-seq data that yields gene expression
estimates that are much more similar to corresponding estimates from microarray
data, hence greatly improving cross-platform comparability. The method we call
PREBS is based on estimating the expression from RNA-seq reads overlapping the
microarray probe regions, and processing these estimates with microarray
summarisation algorithm RMA. Using paired microarray and RNA-seq samples from
TCGA LAML data set we show that PREBS expression estimates derived from RNA-seq
are more similar to microarray-based expression estimates than those from other
RNA-seq processing methods. In an experiment to retrieve paired microarray
samples from a database using an RNA-seq query sample, gene signatures defined
based on PREBS expression estimates were found to be much more accurate than
those from other methods. PREBS also allows new ways of using RNA-seq data,
such as expression estimation for microarray probe sets. An implementation of
the proposed method is available in the Bioconductor package `prebs'.

    <title>On the Structure of the Initiation and Elongation Rates that Maximize
  Protein Production in the Ribosome Flow Model</title>
    <summary>  Translation is a crucial step in gene expression. During translation,
macromolecules called ribosomes "read" the mRNA strand in a sequential manner
and produce a corresponding protein. Translation is known to consume most of
the cell's energy. Maximizing the protein production rate in mRNA translation,
subject to the bounded biomolecullar budget, is thus an important problem in
both biology and biotechnology. We consider this problem using a mathematical
model for mRNA translation called the ribosome flow model (RFM). For an mRNA
strand with $n$ sites the RFM includes $n$ state-variables that encode the
normalized ribosomal density at each site, and $n+1$ positive parameters: the
initiation rate and elongation rates along the chain. An affine constraint on
these rates is used to model the bounded cellular budget. We show that for a
homogeneous constraint the rates that maximize the steady-state protein
production rate have a special structure. They are symmetric with respect to
the middle of the chain, and monotonically increase as we move towards the
center of the chain. The ribosomal densities corresponding to the optimal rates
monotonically decrease along the chain. We discuss some of the biological
implications of these results.

    <title>Integrative multi-omics module network inference with Lemon-Tree</title>
    <summary>  Module network inference is an established statistical method to reconstruct
co-expression modules and their upstream regulatory programs from integrated
multi-omics datasets measuring the activity levels of various cellular
components across different individuals, experimental conditions or time points
of a dynamic process. We have developed Lemon-Tree, an open-source,
platform-independent, modular, extensible software package implementing
state-of-the-art ensemble methods for module network inference. We benchmarked
Lemon-Tree using large-scale tumor datasets and showed that Lemon-Tree
algorithms compare favorably with state-of-the-art module network inference
software. We also analyzed a large dataset of somatic copy-number alterations
and gene expression levels measured in glioblastoma samples from The Cancer
Genome Atlas and found that Lemon-Tree correctly identifies known glioblastoma
oncogenes and tumor suppressors as master regulators in the inferred module
network. Novel candidate driver genes predicted by Lemon-Tree were validated
using tumor pathway and survival analyses. Lemon-Tree is available from

    <title>Topological Features In Cancer Gene Expression Data</title>
    <summary>  We present a new method for exploring cancer gene expression data based on
tools from algebraic topology. Our method selects a small relevant subset from
tens of thousands of genes while simultaneously identifying nontrivial higher
order topological features, i.e., holes, in the data. We first circumvent the
problem of high dimensionality by dualizing the data, i.e., by studying genes
as points in the sample space. Then we select a small subset of the genes as
landmarks to construct topological structures that capture persistent, i.e.,
topologically significant, features of the data set in its first homology
group. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many members of these loops have been
implicated for cancer biogenesis in scientific literature. We illustrate our
method on five different data sets belonging to brain, breast, leukemia, and
ovarian cancers.

    <title>Robust identification of noncoding RNA from transcriptomes requires
  phylogenetically-informed sampling</title>
    <summary>  Noncoding RNAs are integral to a wide range of biological processes,
including translation, gene regulation, host-pathogen interactions and
environmental sensing. While genomics is now a mature field, our capacity to
identify noncoding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes is hampered
by the difficulty of de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies
for characterizing transcriptome outputs, notably RNA-seq, are improving
noncoding RNA identification and expression quantification. However, a major
challenge is to robustly distinguish functional outputs from transcriptional
noise. To establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has
effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400 publicly
available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea and Bacteria. Using
comparative tools, we identify close to a thousand highly-expressed candidate
noncoding RNAs. However, our analyses reveal that capacity to identify
noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling.
Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic
window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely narrow:
aggregating public datasets only produced one phylogenetic cluster where these
tools could be used to robustly separate unannotated noncoding RNAs from a null
hypothesis of transcriptional noise. Our results show that for the full
potential of transcriptomics data to be realized, a change in experimental
design is paramount: effective transcriptomics requires phylogeny-aware
sampling.

    <title>Large scale statistical analysis of GEO datasets</title>
    <summary>  The problem addressed here is that of simultaneous treatment of several gene
expression datasets, possibly collected under different experimental conditions
and/or platforms. Using robust statistics, a large scale statistical analysis
has been conducted over $20$ datasets downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus repository. The differences between datasets are compared to the
variability inside a given dataset. Evidence that meaningful biological
information can be extracted by merging different sources is provided.

    <title>Mapping the Space of Genomic Signatures</title>
    <summary>  We propose a computational method to measure and visualize interrelationships
among any number of DNA sequences allowing, for example, the examination of
hundreds or thousands of complete mitochondrial genomes. An "image distance" is
computed for each pair of graphical representations of DNA sequences, and the
distances are visualized as a Molecular Distance Map: Each point on the map
represents a DNA sequence, and the spatial proximity between any two points
reflects the degree of structural similarity between the corresponding
sequences. The graphical representation of DNA sequences utilized, Chaos Game
Representation (CGR), is genome- and species-specific and can thus act as a
genomic signature. Consequently, Molecular Distance Maps could inform species
identification, taxonomic classifications and, to a certain extent,
evolutionary history. The image distance employed, Structural Dissimilarity
Index (DSSIM), implicitly compares the occurrences of oligomers of length up to
$k$ (herein $k=9$) in DNA sequences. We computed DSSIM distances for more than
5 million pairs of complete mitochondrial genomes, and used Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (MDS) to obtain Molecular Distance Maps that visually display the
sequence relatedness in various subsets, at different taxonomic levels. This
general-purpose method does not require DNA sequence homology and can thus be
used to compare similar or vastly different DNA sequences, genomic or
computer-generated, of the same or different lengths. We illustrate potential
uses of this approach by applying it to several taxonomic subsets: phylum
Vertebrata, (super)kingdom Protista, classes Amphibia-Insecta-Mammalia, class
Amphibia, and order Primates. This analysis of an extensive dataset confirms
that the oligomer composition of full mtDNA sequences can be a source of
taxonomic information.

    <title>Linear Recognition of Almost Interval Graphs</title>
    <summary>  Let $\mbox{interval} + k v$, $\mbox{interval} + k e$, and $\mbox{interval} -
k e$ denote the classes of graphs that can be obtained from some interval graph
by adding $k$ vertices, adding $k$ edges, and deleting $k$ edges, respectively.
When $k$ is small, these graph classes are called almost interval graphs. They
are well motivated from computational biology, where the data ought to be
represented by an interval graph while we can only expect an almost interval
graph for the best. For any fixed $k$, we give linear-time algorithms for
recognizing all these classes, and in the case of membership, our algorithms
provide also a specific interval graph as evidence. When $k$ is part of the
input, these problems are also known as graph modification problems, all
NP-complete. Our results imply that they are fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by $k$, thereby resolving the long-standing open problem on the
parameterized complexity of recognizing $\mbox{interval}+ k e$, first asked by
Bodlaender et al. [Bioinformatics, 11:49--57, 1995]. Moreover, our algorithms
for recognizing $\mbox{interval}+ k v$ and $\mbox{interval}- k e$ run in times
$O(6^k \cdot (n + m))$ and $O(8^k \cdot (n + m))$, (where $n$ and $m$ stand for
the numbers of vertices and edges respectively in the input graph,)
significantly improving the $O(k^{2k}\cdot n^3m)$-time algorithm of Heggernes
et al. [STOC 2007] and the $O(10^k \cdot n^9)$-time algorithm of Cao and Marx
[SODA 2014] respectively.

    <title>Whole genome mapping of 5' RNA ends in bacteria by tagged sequencing : A
  comprehensive view in Enterococcus faecalis</title>
    <summary>  Enterococcus faecalis is the third cause of nosocomial infections. To obtain
the first comprehensive view of transcriptional organizations in this
bacterium, we used a modified RNA-seq approach enabling to discriminate primary
from processed 5'RNA ends. We also validated our approach by confirming known
features in Escherichia coli.
  We mapped 559 transcription start sites and 352 processing sites in E.
faecalis. A blind motif search retrieved canonical features of SigA- and
SigN-dependent promoters preceding TSSs mapped. We discovered 95 novel putative
regulatory RNAs, small- and antisense RNAs, and 72 transcriptional antisense
organisations.
  Presented data constitute a significant insight into bacterial RNA landscapes
and a step towards the inference of regulatory processes at transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels in a comprehensive manner.

    <title>Giant Viruses of the Kutch Desert</title>
    <summary>  The Kutch desert (Great Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, India) is a unique ecosystem:
in the larger part of the year it is a hot, salty desert that is flooded
regularly in the Indian monsoon season. In the dry season, the crystallized
salt deposits form the "white desert" in large regions. The first metagenomic
analysis of the soil samples of Kutch was published in 2013, and the data was
deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. The sequences were analyzed at the
same time phylogenetically for prokaryotes, especially for bacterial taxa.
  In the present work, we are searching for the DNA sequences of the recently
discovered giant viruses in the soil samples of the Kutch desert. Since most
giant viruses were discovered in biofilms in industrial cooling towers, ocean
water and freshwater ponds, we were surprised to find their DNA sequences in
the soil samples of a seasonally very hot and arid, salty environment.

    <title>Synonymous and Nonsynonymous Distances Help Untangle Convergent
  Evolution and Recombination</title>
    <summary>  When estimating a phylogeny from a multiple sequence alignment, researchers
often assume the absence of recombination. However, if recombination is
present, then tree estimation and all downstream analyses will be impacted,
because different segments of the sequence alignment support different
phylogenies. Similarly, convergent selective pressures at the molecular level
can also lead to phylogenetic tree incongruence across the sequence alignment.
Current methods for detection of phylogenetic incongruence are not equipped to
distinguish between these two different mechanisms and assume that the
incongruence is a result of recombination or other horizontal transfer of
genetic information. We propose a new recombination detection method that can
make this distinction, based on synonymous codon substitution distances.
Although some power is lost by discarding the information contained in the
nonsynonymous substitutions, our new method has lower false positive
probabilities than the comparable recombination detection method when the
phylogenetic incongruence signal is due to convergent evolution. We apply our
method to three empirical examples, where we analyze: 1) sequences from a
transmission network of the human immunodeficiency virus, 2) tlpB gene
sequences from a geographically diverse set of 38 Helicobacter pylori strains,
and 3) Hepatitis C virus sequences sampled longitudinally from one patient.

    <title>On the representation of de Bruijn graphs</title>
    <summary>  The de Bruijn graph plays an important role in bioinformatics, especially in
the context of de novo assembly. However, the representation of the de Bruijn
graph in memory is a computational bottleneck for many assemblers. Recent
papers proposed a navigational data structure approach in order to improve
memory usage. We prove several theoretical space lower bounds to show the
limitation of these types of approaches. We further design and implement a
general data structure (DBGFM) and demonstrate its use on a human whole-genome
dataset, achieving space usage of 1.5 GB and a 46% improvement over previous
approaches. As part of DBGFM, we develop the notion of frequency-based
minimizers and show how it can be used to enumerate all maximal simple paths of
the de Bruijn graph using only 43 MB of memory. Finally, we demonstrate that
our approach can be integrated into an existing assembler by modifying the
ABySS software to use DBGFM.

    <title>Moduli Spaces of Phylogenetic Trees Describing Tumor Evolutionary
  Patterns</title>
    <summary>  Cancers follow a clonal Darwinian evolution, with fitter subclones replacing
more quiescent cells, ultimately giving rise to macroscopic disease.
High-throughput genomics provides the opportunity to investigate these
processes and determine specific genetic alterations driving disease
progression. Genomic sampling of a patient's cancer provides a molecular
history, represented by a phylogenetic tree. Cohorts of patients represent a
forest of related phylogenetic structures. To extract clinically relevant
information, one must represent and statistically compare these collections of
trees. We propose a framework based on an application of the work by Billera,
Holmes and Vogtmann on phylogenetic tree spaces to the case of unrooted trees
of intra-individual cancer tissue samples. We observe that these tree spaces
are globally nonpositively curved, allowing for statistical inference on
populations of patient histories. A projective tree space is introduced,
permitting visualizations of aggregate evolutionary behavior. Published data
from three types of human malignancies are explored within our framework.

    <title>Robust Detection of Periodic Patterns in Gene Expression Microarray Data
  using Topological Signal Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a new approach for analyzing gene expression data
that builds on topological characteristics of time series. Our goal is to
identify cell cycle regulated genes in micro array dataset. We construct a
point cloud out of time series using delay coordinate embeddings. Persistent
homology is utilized to analyse the topology of the point cloud for detection
of periodicity. This novel technique is accurate and robust to noise, missing
data points and varying sampling intervals. Our experiments using Yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset substantiate the capabilities of the proposed
method.

    <title>Affinity, stoichiometry and cooperativity of heterochromatin protein 1
  (HP1) binding to nucleosomal arrays</title>
    <summary>  Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) participates in establishing and maintaining
heterochromatin via its histone modification dependent chromatin interactions.
In recent papers HP1 binding to nucleosomal arrays was measured in vitro and
interpreted in terms of nearest-neighbor cooperative binding. This mode of
chromatin interactions could lead to spreading of HP1 along the nucleosome
chain. Here, we reanalyzed previous data by representing the nucleosome chain
as a one-dimensional binding lattice, and show how the experimental HP1 binding
isotherms can be explained by a simpler model without cooperative interactions
between neighboring HP1 dimers. Based on these calculations and spatial models
of dinucleosomes and nucleosome chains, we propose that binding stoichiometry
is dependent of the nucleosome repeat length (NRL) rather than protein
interactions between HP1 dimers. According to our calculations, more open
nucleosome arrays with long DNA linkers are characterized by a larger number of
binding sites in comparison to chains with short NRL. Furthermore, we
demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulations that the NRL dependent folding of the
nucleosome chain can induce allosteric changes of HP1 binding sites. Thus, HP1
chromatin interactions can be modulated by the change of binding stoichiometry
and type of binding to condensed (methylated) and non-condensed (unmethylated)
nucleosome arrays in the absence of direct interactions between HP1 dimers.

    <title>Revised Annotations, Sex-Biased Expression, and Lineage-Specific Genes
  in the Drosophila melanogaster group</title>
    <summary>  Here, we provide revised gene models for D. ananassae, D. yakuba, and D.
simulans, which include UTRs and empirically verified intron-exon boundaries,
as well as ortholog groups identified using a fuzzy reciprocal-best-hit blast
comparison. Using these revised annotations, we perform differential expression
testing using the cufflinks suite to provide a broad overview of differential
expression between reproductive tissues and the carcass. We identify thousands
of genes that are differentially expressed across tissues in D. yakuba and D.
simulans, with roughly 60% agreement in expression patterns of orthologs in D.
yakuba and D. simulans. We identify several cases of putative polycistronic
transcripts, pointing to a combination of transcriptional read-through in the
genome as well as putative gene fusion and fission events across taxa. We
furthermore identify hundreds of lineage specific genes in each species with no
blast hits among transcripts of any other Drosophila species, which are
candidates for neofunctionalized proteins and a potential source of genetic
novelty.

    <title>Network analysis reveals a potentially 'evil' alliance of opportunistic
  pathogens inhibited by a cooperative network in human milk bacterial
  communities</title>
    <summary>  The critical importance of human milk to infants and even human civilization
has been well established. Although the human milk microbiome has received
increasing attention with the expansion of research on the human microbiome,
our understanding of the milk microbiome has been limited to cataloguing OTUs
and computation of community diversity indexes. To the best of our knowledge,
there has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk
microbiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community
network with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA
sequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis
revealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected
sub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of
seven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria
are facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other
sub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat
surprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are
mutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include
some opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between
Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes
who cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the
'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk
microbiome should have important health implications to lactating women and
their infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be
responsible for dysbiosis of the milk microbiome that permits mastitis. A
related study focusing on ecological analysis was reported at
(http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/scp-ahb090214.php).

    <title>A Statistical Approach to Identifying Significant Transgenerational
  Methylation Changes</title>
    <summary>  Epigenetic aberrations have profound effects on phenotypic output. Genome
wide methylation alterations are inheritable to pass down the aberrations
through multiple generations. We developed a statistical method, Genome-wide
Identification of Significant Methylation Alteration, GISAIM, to study the
significant transgenerational methylation changes. GISAIM finds the significant
methylation aberrations that are inherited through multiple generations. In a
concrete biological study, we investigated whether exposing pregnant rats (F0)
to a high fat (HF) diet throughout pregnancy or ethinyl estradiol
(EE2)-supplemented diet during gestation days 14 20 affects carcinogen-induced
mammary cancer risk in daughters (F1), granddaughters (F2) and
great-granddaughters (F3). Mammary tumorigenesis was higher in daughters and
granddaughters of HF rat dams, and in daughters, granddaughters and
great-granddaughters of EE2 rat dams. Outcross experiments showed that
increased mammary cancer risk was transmitted to HF granddaughters equally
through the female or male germlines, but is only transmitted to EE2
granddaughters through the female germline. Transgenerational effect on mammary
cancer risk was associated with increased expression of DNA methyltransferases,
and across all three EE2 generations hypo or hyper methylation of the same 375
gene promoter regions in their mammary glands. Our study shows that maternal
dietary estrogenic exposures during pregnancy can increase breast cancer risk
in multiple generations of offspring, and the increase in risk may be inherited
through non-genetic means, possibly involving DNA methylation.

    <title>A feasible roadmap to identifying significant intercellular genomic
  heterogeneity in deep sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Intercellular heterogeneity serves as both a confounding factor in studying
individual clones and an information source in characterizing any heterogeneous
tissues, such as blood, tumor systems. Due to inevitable sequencing errors and
other sample preparation artifacts such as PCR errors, systematic efforts to
characterize intercellular genomic heterogeneity must effectively distinguish
genuine clonal sequences from fake derivatives. We developed a novel approach
(SIGH) for identifying significant genuine clonal sequences directly from mixed
sequencing reads that can improve genomic analyses in many biological contexts.
This method offers several attractive features: (1) it automatically estimates
the error rate from raw sequence reads and identifies genuine clonal sequences;
(2) it is robust to the large variety of error rate due to the various
experimental conditions; (3) it is supported by a well grounded statistical
framework that exploits probabilistic characteristics of sequencing errors; (4)
its unbiased strategy allows detecting rare clone(s) despite that clone
relative abundance; and (5) it estimates constituent proportions in each
sample. Extensive realistic simulation studies show that our method can
reliably estimate the error rates and faithfully distinguish the genuine clones
from fake derivatives, paving the way for follow up analysis that is otherwise
ruined by the often dominant fake clones.

    <title>Bayesian Inference for Tumor Subclones Accounting for Sequencing and
  Structural Variants</title>
    <summary>  Tumor samples are heterogeneous. They consist of different subclones that are
characterized by differences in DNA nucleotide sequences and copy numbers on
multiple loci. Heterogeneity can be measured through the identification of the
subclonal copy number and sequence at a selected set of loci. Understanding
that the accurate identification of variant allele fractions greatly depends on
a precise determination of copy numbers, we develop a Bayesian feature
allocation model for jointly calling subclonal copy numbers and the
corresponding allele sequences for the same loci. The proposed method utilizes
three random matrices, L, Z and w to represent subclonal copy numbers (L),
numbers of subclonal variant alleles (Z) and cellular fractions of subclones in
samples (w), respectively. The unknown number of subclones implies a random
number of columns for these matrices. We use next-generation sequencing data to
estimate the subclonal structures through inference on these three matrices.
Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we demonstrate how posterior
inference on the subclonal structure is enhanced with the joint modeling of
both structure and sequencing variants on subclonal genomes. Software is

developing aim at improving our understanding of the regulation processes
happening in normal and cancer cells. This topic connects together the projects
presented in this thesis. Two chapters of the thesis represent major areas of
my research interests: (1) methods for deciphering transcriptional regulation
and their application to answer specific biological questions, and (2) methods
to study the genome structure and their application in cancer studies. The
first chapter predominantly focuses on transcriptional regulation. Here I
describe my contribution to the development of methodology for the discovery of
transcription factor binding sites and the positioning of histone proteins. I
also explain how sequence analysis, in combination with gene expression data,
can allow the identification of direct target genes of a transcription factor
under study, as well as the physical mechanisms of its action. As two examples,
I provide the results of my study of transcriptional regulation by (i)
oncogenic protein EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma and (ii) oncogenic transcription
factor Spi-1/PU.1 in erythroleukemia. In the second chapter, I describe the
sequence analysis methods aimed at the identification of the genomic
rearrangements in species with existing reference genome. I explain how the
developed methodology can be applied to detect the structure of cancer genomes.
I provide an example of how such an analysis of tumor genomes can result in a
discovery of a new phenomenon: chromothripsis, when hundreds of rearrangements
occur in a single cellular catastrophe. The thesis is concluded by listing the
major challenges in high-throughput sequencing analysis. I also discuss the
current top questions demanding the integration of sequencing data.

    <title>Visual annotations and a supervised learning approach for evaluating and
  calibrating ChIP-seq peak detectors</title>
    <summary>  Many peak detection algorithms have been proposed for ChIP-seq data analysis,
but it is not obvious which method and what parameters are optimal for any
given data set. In contrast, peaks can easily be located by visual inspection
of profile data on a genome browser. We thus propose a supervised machine
learning approach to ChIP-seq data analysis, using annotated regions that
encode an expert's qualitative judgments about which regions contain or do not
contain peaks. The main idea is to manually annotate a small subset of the
genome, and then learn a model that makes consistent predictions on the rest of
the genome. We show how our method can be used to quantitatively calibrate and
benchmark the performance of peak detection algorithms on specific data sets.
We compare several peak detectors on 7 annotated region data sets, consisting
of 2 histone marks, 4 expert annotators, and several different cell types. In
these data the macs algorithm was best for a narrow peak histone profile
(H3K4me3) while the hmcan.broad algorithm was best for a broad histone profile
(H3K36me3). Our benchmark annotated region data sets can be downloaded from a
public website, and there is an R package for computing the annotation error on
GitHub.

    <title>Structuring research methods and data with the Research Object model:
  genomics workflows as a case study</title>
    <summary>  One of the main challenges for biomedical research lies in the
computer-assisted integrative study of large and increasingly complex
combinations of data in order to understand molecular mechanisms. The
preservation of the materials and methods of such computational experiments
with clear annotations is essential for understanding an experiment, and this
is increasingly recognized in the bioinformatics community. Our assumption is
that offering means of digital, structured aggregation and annotation of the
objects of an experiment will provide necessary meta-data for a scientist to
understand and recreate the results of an experiment. To support this we
explored a model for the semantic description of a workflow-centric Research
Object (RO), where an RO is defined as a resource that aggregates other
resources, e.g., datasets, software, spreadsheets, text, etc. We applied this
model to a case study where we analysed human metabolite variation by
workflows.

    <title>Sensitivity of mRNA Translation</title>
    <summary>  Using the dynamic mean-field approximation of the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process (TASEP), we investigate the effect of small changes in the
initiation, exit, and elongation rates along the mRNA strand on the steady
state protein translation rate. We focus on two special cases where exact
closed-form expressions for the translation rate sensitivity can be derived. We
discuss the ramifications of our results in the context of functional genomics,
molecular evolution, and synthetic biology.

    <title>Gaussian process test for high-throughput sequencing time series:
  application to experimental evolution</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have made it
possible to monitor genomes in great detail. New experiments not only use HTS
to measure genomic features at one time point but to monitor them changing over
time with the aim of identifying significant changes in their abundance. In
population genetics, for example, allele frequencies are monitored over time to
detect significant frequency changes that indicate selection pressures.
Previous attempts at analysing data from HTS experiments have been limited as
they could not simultaneously include data at intermediate time points,
replicate experiments and sources of uncertainty specific to HTS such as
sequencing depth.
  Results: We present the beta-binomial Gaussian process (BBGP) model for
ranking features with significant non-random variation in abundance over time.
The features are assumed to represent proportions, such as proportion of an
alternative allele in a population. We use the beta-binomial model to capture
the uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and combine it with a
Gaussian process model over the time series. In simulations that mimic the
features of experimental evolution data, the proposed method clearly
outperforms classical testing in average precision of finding selected alleles.
We also present simulations exploring different experimental design choices and
results on real data from Drosophila experimental evolution experiment in
temperature adaptation.

    <title>MaxSSmap: A GPU program for mapping divergent short reads to genomes
  with the maximum scoring subsequence</title>
    <summary>  Programs based on hash tables and Burrows-Wheeler are very fast for mapping
short reads to genomes but have low accuracy in the presence of mismatches and
gaps. Such reads can be aligned accurately with the Smith-Waterman algorithm
but it can take hours and days to map millions of reads even for bacteria
genomes. We introduce a GPU program called MaxSSmap with the aim of achieving
comparable accuracy to Smith-Waterman but with faster runtimes. Similar to most
programs MaxSSmap identifies a local region of the genome followed by exact
alignment. Instead of using hash tables or Burrows-Wheeler in the first part,
MaxSSmap calculates maximum scoring subsequence score between the read and
disjoint fragments of the genome in parallel on a GPU and selects the highest
scoring fragment for exact alignment. We evaluate MaxSSmap's accuracy and
runtime when mapping simulated Illumina E.coli and human chromosome one reads
of different lengths and 10\% to 30\% mismatches with gaps to the E.coli genome
and human chromosome one. We also demonstrate applications on real data by
mapping ancient horse DNA reads to modern genomes and unmapped paired reads
from NA12878 in 1000 genomes. We show that MaxSSmap attains comparable high
accuracy and low error to fast Smith-Waterman programs yet has much lower
runtimes. We show that MaxSSmap can map reads rejected by BWA and NextGenMap
with high accuracy and low error much faster than if Smith-Waterman were used.
On short read lengths of 36 and 51 both MaxSSmap and Smith-Waterman have lower
accuracy compared to at higher lengths. On real data MaxSSmap produces many
alignments with high score and mapping quality that are not given by NextGenMap
and BWA. The MaxSSmap source code is freely available from
http://www.cs.njit.edu/usman/MaxSSmap.

    <title>Methods for Joint Imaging and RNA-seq Data Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Emerging integrative analysis of genomic and anatomical imaging data which
has not been well developed, provides invaluable information for the holistic
discovery of the genomic structure of disease and has the potential to open a
new avenue for discovering novel disease susceptibility genes which cannot be
identified if they are analyzed separately. A key issue to the success of
imaging and genomic data analysis is how to reduce their dimensions. Most
previous methods for imaging information extraction and RNA-seq data reduction
do not explore imaging spatial information and often ignore gene expression
variation at genomic positional level. To overcome these limitations, we extend
functional principle component analysis from one dimension to two dimension
(2DFPCA) for representing imaging data and develop a multiple functional linear
model (MFLM) in which functional principal scores of images are taken as
multiple quantitative traits and RNA-seq profile across a gene is taken as a
function predictor for assessing the association of gene expression with
images. The developed method has been applied to image and RNA-seq data of
ovarian cancer and KIRC studies. We identified 24 and 84 genes whose
expressions were associated with imaging variations in ovarian cancer and KIRC
studies, respectively. Our results showed that many significantly associated
genes with images were not differentially expressed, but revealed their
morphological and metabolic functions. The results also demonstrated that the
peaks of the estimated regression coefficient function in the MFLM often
allowed the discovery of splicing sites and multiple isoform of gene
expressions.

    <title>Target enrichment of ultraconserved elements from arthropods provides a
  genomic perspective on relationships among Hymenoptera</title>
    <summary>  Gaining a genomic perspective on phylogeny requires the collection of data
from many putatively independent loci collected across the genome. Among
insects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data
involves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome
sequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the
transcribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome
to target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are
similar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have
traditionally worked (e.g., exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA
as a template are limited to using very high quality source materials, which
are often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect
samples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved
genomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across
insect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be
collected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n$=$1510) of
ultraconserved elements (UCE) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera. We use
in silico analyses to show that these loci accurately reconstruct relationships
among genome-enabled Hymenoptera, and we design a set of baits for enriching
these loci that researchers can use with DNA templates extracted from a variety
of sources. We use our UCE bait set to enrich an average of 721 UCE loci from
30 hymenopteran taxa, and we use these UCE loci to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships spanning very old ($\geq$220 MYA) to very young ($\leq$1 MYA)
divergences among hymenopteran lineages. In contrast to a recent study
addressing hymenopteran phylogeny using transcriptome data, we found ants to be
sister to all remaining aculeate lineages with complete support.

    <title>Behavioral individuality reveals genetic control of phenotypic
  variability</title>
    <summary>  Variability is ubiquitous in nature and a fundamental feature of complex
systems. Few studies, however, have investigated variance itself as a trait
under genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the
effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an
important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences
among individuals. To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual
phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of
Drosophila inbred lines and focused on locomotor handedness, in an assay
optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had
consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while
others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself
heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of
intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several
genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without
affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the
central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral
variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor
coordination. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null
alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of
phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it shows that different
genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic
variability. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of
variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important
links between genotype and phenotype.

    <title>Understanding genomic alterations in cancer genomes using an integrative
  network approach</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, cancer genome sequencing and other high-throughput studies
of cancer genomes have generated many notable discoveries. In this review,
Novel genomic alteration mechanisms, such as chromothripsis (chromosomal
crisis) and kataegis (mutation storms), and their implications for cancer are
discussed. Genomic alterations spur cancer genome evolution. Thus, the
relationship between cancer clonal evolution and cancer stems cells is
commented. The key question in cancer biology concerns how these genomic
alterations support cancer development and metastasis in the context of
biological functioning. Thus far, efforts such as pathway analysis have
improved the understanding of the functional contributions of genetic mutations
and DNA copy number variations to cancer development, progression and
metastasis. However, the known pathways correspond to a small fraction,
plausibly 5-10%, of somatic mutations and genes with an altered copy number. To
develop a comprehensive understanding of the function of these genomic
alterations in cancer, an integrative network framework is proposed and
discussed. Finally, the challenges and the directions of studying cancer omic
data using an integrative network approach are commented.

    <title>Scalable Genomics with R and Bioconductor</title>
    <summary>  This paper reviews strategies for solving problems encountered when analyzing
large genomic data sets and describes the implementation of those strategies in
R by packages from the Bioconductor project. We treat the scalable processing,
summarization and visualization of big genomic data. The general ideas are well
established and include restrictive queries, compression, iteration and
parallel computing. We demonstrate the strategies by applying Bioconductor
packages to the detection and analysis of genetic variants from a whole genome
sequencing experiment.

    <title>Convex Clustering: An Attractive Alternative to Hierarchical Clustering</title>
    <summary>  The primary goal in cluster analysis is to discover natural groupings of
objects. The field of cluster analysis is crowded with diverse methods that
make special assumptions about data and address different scientific aims.
Despite its shortcomings in accuracy, hierarchical clustering is the dominant
clustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find the trees constructed by
hierarchical clustering visually appealing and in tune with their evolutionary
perspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales
simultaneously. This is essential, for instance, in transcriptome data where
one may be interested in making qualitative inferences about how lower-order
relationships like gene modules lead to higher-order relationships like
pathways or biological processes. The recently developed method of convex
clustering preserves the visual appeal of hierarchical clustering while
ameliorating its propensity to make false inferences in the presence of
outliers and noise. The current paper exploits the proximal distance principle
to construct a novel algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. The
solution paths generated by convex clustering reveal relationships between
clusters that are hidden by static methods such as k-means clustering. Our
convex clustering software separates parameters, accommodates missing data, and
supports prior information on relationships. The software is implemented on ATI
and nVidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for maximal speed. Several
biological examples illustrate the strengths of convex clustering and the
ability of the proximal distance algorithm to handle high-dimensional problems.

    <title>Role of the host genetic variability in the influenza-A virus
  susceptibility; a review</title>
    <summary>  The aftermath of influenza infection is determined by a complex set of
host-pathogen interactions, where genomic variability on both viral and host
sides influences the final outcome. Although there exists large body of
literature describing influenza virus variability, only a very small fraction
covers the issue of host variance. The goal of this review is to explore the
variability of host genes responsible for host-pathogen interactions, paying
particular attention to genes responsible for the presence of sialylated
glycans in the host endothelial membrane, mucus, genes used by viral immune
escape mechanisms, and genes particularly expressed after vaccination, since
they are more likely to have a direct influence on the infection outcome.

    <title>GeneNetMiner: accurately mining gene regulatory networks from literature</title>
    <summary>  GeneNetMiner is standalone software which parses the sentences of iHOP and
captures regulatory relations. The regulatory relations are either gene gene
regulations or gene biological processes relations. Capturing of gene
biological process relations is a unique feature for the tools of this kind.
These relations can be used to build up gene regulatory networks for specific
biological processes, diseases, or phenotypes. Users are able to search genes
and biological processes to find the regulatory relationships between them.
Each regulatory relationship has been assigned a confidence score, which
indicates the probability of the true relation. Furthermore, it reports the
sentence containing the queried terms, which allows users to manually checking
whether the relation is true if they wish. GeneNetMiner is able to accurately
capture the regulatory relationships between genes from literature.

    <title>Collective regulation by non-coding RNA</title>
    <summary>  We study genetic networks that produce many species of non-coding RNA
molecules that are present at a moderate density, as typically exists in the
cell. The associations of the many species of these RNA are modeled physically,
taking into account the equilibrium constants between bound and unbound states.
By including the pair-wise binding of the many RNA species, the network becomes
highly interconnected and shows different properties than the usual type of
genetic network. It shows much more robustness to mutation, and also rapid
evolutionary adaptation in an environment that oscillates in time. This
provides a possible explanation for the weak evolutionary constraints seen in
much of the non-coding RNA that has been studied.

    <title>Genetic influences on translation in yeast</title>
    <summary>  Heritable differences in gene expression between individuals are an important
source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of
genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open.
Here, we addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how
genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect
translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of
genes. Allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two
strains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were
observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, most effects on
translation were of small magnitude, such that the direction of an mRNA
difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The
relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was
similar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation to cause
larger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA
differences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast
species that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA
differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation
termination in the two yeast strains and also found several instances where
erroneous reference gene annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that
in fact reside outside of the translated gene body. Overall, genetic influences
on translation subtly modulate gene expression differences, and translation
does not create strong discrepancies between genetic influences on mRNA and
protein levels.

    <title>On the genetic architecture of intelligence and other quantitative
  traits</title>
    <summary>  How do genes affect cognitive ability or other human quantitative traits such
as height or disease risk? Progress on this challenging question is likely to
be significant in the near future. I begin with a brief review of psychometric
measurements of intelligence, introducing the idea of a "general factor" or g
score. The main results concern the stability, validity (predictive power), and
heritability of adult g. The largest component of genetic variance for both
height and intelligence is additive (linear), leading to important
simplifications in predictive modeling and statistical estimation. Due mainly
to the rapidly decreasing cost of genotyping, it is possible that within the
coming decade researchers will identify loci which account for a significant
fraction of total g variation. In the case of height analogous efforts are well
under way. I describe some unpublished results concerning the genetic
architecture of height and cognitive ability, which suggest that roughly 10k
moderately rare causal variants of mostly negative effect are responsible for
normal population variation. Using results from Compressed Sensing
(L1-penalized regression), I estimate the statistical power required to
characterize both linear and nonlinear models for quantitative traits. The main
unknown parameter s (sparsity) is the number of loci which account for the bulk
of the genetic variation. The required sample size is of order 100s, or roughly
a million in the case of cognitive ability.

and chimpanzee exhibit an exponential length distribution, in contrast to the

a truncated algebraic component primarily composed of paralogous sequences.

    <title>FIT: Tag based method for fusion proteins identification</title>
    <summary>  There is increased interest in the identification and analysis of gene
fusions and chimeric RNA transcripts. While most recent efforts focused on the
analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data, identi-fication of novel peptides
corresponding to such events in mass spectrometry-based proteomic datasets
would provide complemen-tary, protein-level evidence. The process of
identifying fusion pro-teins from mass spectrometry data is inherently
difficult because such events are rare. It is also complicated due to large
amount of spectra collected and the explosion in the number of candidate
peptide sequences that need to be considered, which makes ex-haustive search
for all possible fusion partner proteins impractical. In this work, we present
a sequence tag based fusion protein identi-fication algorithm, FIT, that
combines the virtue of both de novo sequence tag retrieval and peptide-spectrum
matching for identifi-cation of fusion proteins. Results on simulated datasets
show high sensitivity and low false positive rates for fusion protein
identifica-tion by the FIT algorithm.

iterations. The results are automati-cally summarized for easier determination
of the K value that best fit the data. In addition, CloudSTRUCTURE will
reformat STRUCTURE output for use in downstream programs, such as TASSEL for

    <title>The degenerative evolution from multicellularity to unicellularity
  during cancer</title>
    <summary>  Theoretical reasoning suggests that human cancer may result from knocking
down the genetic constraints evolved for maintenance of the metazoan
multicellularity, which, however, requires a critical test. Using
xenograft-based experimental evolution we characterized for the first time the
full life history from initiation to metastasis of a tumor at the genomic and
transcriptomic levels, and observed metastasis-driving positive selection for
generally loss-of-function mutations on a set of multicellularity-related
genes, which is further supported by large-scale exome data of clinical tumor
samples. Subsequent expression analysis revealed mainly expression
down-regulation of multicellularity-related genes, which form an evolving
expression profile approaching that of embryonic stem cells, the cell type with
the most characteristics of unicellular life. The theoretical conjecture
predicts that genes born at the emergence of metazoan multicellularity tend to
be cancer drivers, which we validated using a rigorous phylostratigraphy
analysis on the birth rate of genes annotated by Cancer Gene Census. Also, the
number of loss-of-function tumor suppressors often predominates over activated
oncogenes in a typical tumor of human patients. These data collectively suggest
that, different from typical organismal evolution in which gain of new genes is
the mainstream, cancer represents a loss-of-function-driven degenerative
evolution back to the unicellular ground state. This cancer evolution model may
explain the enormous tumoral genetic heterogeneity in the clinic, underlie how
distant-organ metastases originate in primary tumors despite distinct
environmental requirements, and hold implications for designing effective
cancer therapy.

Middle/Upper Paleolithic following the appearance of anatomically modern humans
was due to the onset of dual processing or contextual focus (CF), the ability
to shift between different modes of thought: an explicit mode conducive to
logical problem solving, and an implicit mode conducive to free-association and
breaking out of a rut. Mathematical and computational models of CF supported
this hypothesis, showing that CF is conducive to making creative connections by
placing concepts in new contexts. This paper proposes that CF was made possible
by mutation of the FOXP2 gene in the Paleolithic. FOXP2, once thought to be the
'language gene', turned out not to be uniquely associated with language. In its
modern form FOXP2 enabled fine-tuning of the neurological mechanisms underlying
the capacity to shift between processing modes by varying the size of the
activated region of memory.

    <title>Paleoproteomics explained to youngsters: how did the wedding of
  two-dimensional electrophoresis and protein sequencing spark proteomics on:
  Let there be light</title>
    <summary>  Taking the opportunity of the 20th anniversary of the word "proteomics", this
young adult age is a good time to remember how proteomics came from enormous
progress in protein separation and protein microanalysis techniques, and from
the conjugation of these advances into a high performance and streamlined
working setup. However, in the history of the almost three decades that
encompass the first attempts to perform large scale analysis of proteins to the
current high throughput proteomics that we can enjoy now, it is also
interesting to underline and to recall how difficult the first decade was.
Indeed when the word was cast, the battle was already won. This recollection is
mostly devoted to the almost forgotten period where proteomics was being
conceived and put to birth, as this collective scientific work will never
appear when searched through the keyword "proteomics". BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
The significance of this manuscript is to recall and review the two decades
that separated the first attempts of performing large scale analysis of
proteins from the solid technical corpus that existed when the word
"proteomics" was coined twenty years ago. This recollection is made within the
scientific historical context of this decade, which also saw the blossoming of
DNA cloning and sequencing. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
20 years of Proteomics in memory of Viatliano Pallini. Guest Editors: Luca Bini
, Juan J. Calvete, Natacha Turck, Denis Hochstrasser and Jean-Charles Sanchez.

    <title>BACOM 2.0 facilitates absolute normalization and quantification of
  somatic copy number alterations in heterogeneous tumor</title>
    <summary>  BACOM is a statistically principled and unsupervised method that detects copy
number deletion types (homozygous versus heterozygous), estimates normal cell
fraction, and recovers cancer specific copy number profiles, using allele
specific copy number signals. In a subsequent analysis of TCGA ovarian cancer
dataset, the average normal cell fraction estimated by BACOM was found higher
than expected. In this letter, we first discuss the advantages of the BACOM in
relation to alternative approaches. Then, we show that this elevated estimate
of normal cell fraction is the combined result of inaccurate signal modeling
and normalization. Lastly, we describe an allele specific signal modeling and
normalization scheme that can enhance BACOM applications in many biological
contexts. An open source MATLAB program was developed to implement our extended
method and it is publically available.

    <title>Signalling Entropy: a novel network-theoretical framework for systems
  analysis and interpretation of functional omic data</title>
    <summary>  A key challenge in systems biology is the elucidation of the underlying
principles, or fundamental laws, which determine the cellular phenotype.
Understanding how these fundamental principles are altered in diseases like
cancer is important for translating basic scientific knowledge into clinical
advances. While significant progress is being made, with the identification of
novel drug targets and treatments by means of systems biological methods, our
fundamental systems level understanding of why certain treatments succeed and
others fail is still lacking. We here advocate a novel methodological framework
for systems analysis and interpretation of molecular omic data, which is based
on statistical mechanical principles. Specifically, we propose the notion of
cellular signalling entropy (or uncertainty), as a novel means of analysing and
interpreting omic data, and more fundamentally, as a means of elucidating
systems-level principles underlying basic biology and disease. We describe the
power of signalling entropy to discriminate cells according to differentiation
potential and cancer status. We further argue the case for an empirical
cellular entropy-robustness correlation theorem and demonstrate its existence
in cancer cell line drug sensitivity data. Specifically, we find that high
signalling entropy correlates with drug resistance and further describe how
entropy could be used to identify the achilles heels of cancer cells. In
summary, signalling entropy is a deep and powerful concept, based on rigorous
statistical mechanical principles, which, with improved data quality and
coverage, will allow a much deeper understanding of the systems biological
principles underlying normal and disease physiology.

    <title>Genetic Sequence Matching Using D4M Big Data Approaches</title>
    <summary>  Recent technological advances in Next Generation Sequencing tools have led to
increasing speeds of DNA sample collection, preparation, and sequencing. One
instrument can produce over 600 Gb of genetic sequence data in a single run.
This creates new opportunities to efficiently handle the increasing workload.
We propose a new method of fast genetic sequence analysis using the Dynamic
Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) - an associative array environment for
MATLAB developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Based on mathematical and
statistical properties, the method leverages big data techniques and the
implementation of an Apache Acculumo database to accelerate computations
one-hundred fold over other methods. Comparisons of the D4M method with the
current gold-standard for sequence analysis, BLAST, show the two are comparable
in the alignments they find. This paper will present an overview of the D4M
genetic sequence algorithm and statistical comparisons with BLAST.

    <title>Fast Genome-Wide QTL Analysis Using Mendel</title>
    <summary>  Pedigree GWAS (Option 29) in the current version of the Mendel software is an
optimized subroutine for performing large scale genome-wide QTL analysis. This
analysis (a) works for random sample data, pedigree data, or a mix of both, (b)
is highly efficient in both run time and memory requirement, (c) accommodates
both univariate and multivariate traits, (d) works for autosomal and x-linked
loci, (e) correctly deals with missing data in traits, covariates, and
genotypes, (f) allows for covariate adjustment and constraints among
parameters, (g) uses either theoretical or SNP-based empirical kinship matrix
for additive polygenic effects, (h) allows extra variance components such as
dominant polygenic effects and household effects, (i) detects and reports
outlier individuals and pedigrees, and (j) allows for robust estimation via the
$t$-distribution. The current paper assesses these capabilities on the genetics
analysis workshop 19 (GAW19) sequencing data. We analyzed simulated and real
phenotypes for both family and random sample data sets. For instance, when
jointly testing the 8 longitudinally measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) traits, it takes Mendel 78 minutes on a standard
laptop computer to read, quality check, and analyze a data set with 849
individuals and 8.3 million SNPs. Genome-wide eQTL analysis of 20,643
expression traits on 641 individuals with 8.3 million SNPs takes 30 hours using
20 parallel runs on a cluster. Mendel is freely available at

    <title>YFitter: Maximum likelihood assignment of Y chromosome haplogroups from
  low-coverage sequence data</title>
    <summary>  Low-coverage short-read resequencing experiments have the potential to expand
our understanding of Y chromosome haplogroups. However, the uncertainty
associated with these experiments mean that haplogroups must be assigned
probabilistically to avoid false inferences. We propose an efficient dynamic
programming algorithm that can assign haplogroups by maximum likelihood, and
represent the uncertainty in assignment. We apply this to both genotype and
low-coverage sequencing data, and show that it can assign haplogroups
accurately and with high resolution. The method is implemented as the program
YFitter, which can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/yfitter/

    <title>Aber-OWL: a framework for ontology-based data access in biology</title>
    <summary>  Many ontologies have been developed in biology and these ontologies
increasingly contain large volumes of formalized knowledge commonly expressed
in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Computational access to the knowledge
contained within these ontologies relies on the use of automated reasoning. We
have developed the Aber-OWL infrastructure that provides reasoning services for
bio-ontologies. Aber-OWL consists of an ontology repository, a set of web
services and web interfaces that enable ontology-based semantic access to
biological data and literature. Aber-OWL is freely available at

    <title>Generalized Integrated Functional Test for Regional Methylation Rates</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Methods are needed to test pre-defined genomic regions such as
promoters for differential methylation in genome-wide association studies,
where the number of samples is limited and the data have large amounts of
measurement error. Results: We developed a new statistical test, the
generalized integrated functional test (GIFT), which tests for regional
differences in methylation based on differences in the functional relationship
between methylation percent and location of the CpG sites within a region. In
this method, subject-specific functional profiles are first estimated, and the
average profile within groups is compared between groups using an ANOVA-like
test. Simulations and analyses of data obtained from patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia indicate that GIFT has good statistical properties and is
able to identify promising genomic regions. Further, GIFT is likely to work
with multiple different types of experiments since different smoothing
functions can be used to estimate the functional relationship between
methylation percent and CpG site location. Availability and Implementation:
Matlab code for GIFT and sample data are available at

    <title>Maximizing Protein Translation Rate in the Nonhomogeneous Ribosome Flow
  Model: A Convex Optimization Approach</title>
    <summary>  Translation is an important stage in gene expression. During this stage,
macro-molecules called ribosomes travel along the mRNA strand linking
amino-acids together in a specific order to create a functioning protein. An
important question is how to maximize protein production. Indeed, translation
is known to consume most of the cell's energy and it is natural to assume that
evolution shaped this process so that it maximizes the protein production rate.
If this is indeed so then one can estimate various parameters of the
translation machinery by solving an appropriate mathematical optimization
problem. The same problem also arises in the context of synthetic biology,
namely, re-engineer heterologous genes in order to maximize their translation
rate in a host organism. We consider the problem of maximizing the protein
production rate using a computational model for translation-elongation called
the ribosome flow model (RFM). This model describes the flow of the ribosomes
along an mRNA chain of length n using a set of n first-order nonlinear ODEs. It
also includes n+1 positive parameters: the ribosomal initiation rate into the
mRNA chain, and n elongation rates along the chain sites. We show that the
steady-state translation rate in the RFM is a strictly concave function of its
parameters. This means that the problem of maximizing the translation rate
under a suitable constraint always admits a unique solution, and that this
solution can be determined using highly-efficient algorithms for solving convex
optimization problems even for large values of n. Furthermore, our analysis
shows that the optimal translation rate can be computed based only on the
optimal initiation rate and the elongation rate of the codons near the
beginning of the ORF. We discuss some applications of the theoretical results
to synthetic biology, molecular evolution, and functional genomics.

    <title>These are not the k-mers you are looking for: efficient online k-mer
  counting using a probabilistic data structure</title>
    <summary>  K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in nucleotide
sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo assembly, repeat
detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the khmer software
package for fast and memory efficient online counting of k-mers in sequencing
data sets. Unlike previous methods based on data structures such as hash
tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer relies entirely on a simple
probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch. The Count-Min Sketch permits
online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to
support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On sparse data sets this data
structure is considerably more memory efficient than any exact data structure.
In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces a systematic overcount
for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the k-mers, are stored. Here we
analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the miscount rate of khmer for
generating k-mer frequency distributions and retrieving k-mer counts for
individual k-mers. We also compare the performance of khmer to several other
k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer, Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC,
Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of profiling
sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and digital normalization of reads
in the context of high khmer false positive rates. khmer is implemented in C++
wrapped in a Python interface, offers a tested and robust API, and is freely
available under the BSD license at github.com/ged-lab/khmer.

    <title>Selscan: an efficient multi-threaded program to perform EHH-based scans
  for positive selection</title>
    <summary>  Haplotype-based scans to detect natural selection are useful to identify
recent or ongoing positive selection in genomes. As both real and simulated
genomic datasets grow larger, spanning thousands of samples and millions of
markers, there is a need for a fast and efficient implementation of these scans
for general use. Here we present selscan, an efficient multi-threaded
application that implements Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH), Integrated
Haplotype Score (iHS), and Cross-population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity
(XPEHH). selscan accepts phased genotypes in multiple formats, including TPED,
and performs extremely well on both simulated and real data and over an order
of magnitude faster than existing available implementations. It calculates iHS
on chromosome 22 (22,147 loci) across 204 CEU haplotypes in 353s on one thread
(33s on 16 threads) and calculates XPEHH for the same data relative to 210 YRI
haplotypes in 578s on one thread (52s on 16 threads). Source code and binaries
(Windows, OSX and Linux) are available at https://github.com/szpiech/selscan .

    <title>Analysis of cellular responses of macrophages to zinc ions and zinc
  oxide nanoparticles: a combined targeted and proteomic approach</title>
    <summary>  Two different zinc oxide nanoparticles, as well as zinc ions, are used to
study the cellular responses of the RAW 264 macrophage cell line. A proteomic
screen is used to provide a wide view of the molecular effects of zinc, and the
most prominent results are cross-validated by targeted studies. Furthermore,
the alteration of important macrophage functions (e.g. phagocytosis) by zinc is
also investigated. The intracellular dissolution/uptake of zinc is also studied
to further characterize zinc toxicity. Zinc oxide nanoparticles dissolve
readily in the cells, leading to high intracellular zinc concentrations, mostly
as protein-bound zinc. The proteomic screen reveals a rather weak response in
the oxidative stress response pathway, but a strong response both in the
central metabolism and in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway. Targeted
experiments confirm that carbohydrate catabolism and proteasome are critical
determinants of sensitivity to zinc, which also induces DNA damage. Conversely,
glutathione levels and phagocytosis appear unaffected at moderately toxic zinc
concentrations.

    <title>Bayesian Structured Sparsity from Gaussian Fields</title>
    <summary>  Substantial research on structured sparsity has contributed to analysis of
many different applications. However, there have been few Bayesian procedures
among this work. Here, we develop a Bayesian model for structured sparsity that
uses a Gaussian process (GP) to share parameters of the sparsity-inducing prior
in proportion to feature similarity as defined by an arbitrary positive
definite kernel. For linear regression, this sparsity-inducing prior on
regression coefficients is a relaxation of the canonical spike-and-slab prior
that flattens the mixture model into a scale mixture of normals. This prior
retains the explicit posterior probability on inclusion parameters---now with
GP probit prior distributions---but enables tractable computation via
elliptical slice sampling for the latent Gaussian field. We motivate
development of this prior using the genomic application of association mapping,
or identifying genetic variants associated with a continuous trait. Our
Bayesian structured sparsity model produced sparse results with substantially
improved sensitivity and precision relative to comparable methods. Through
simulations, we show that three properties are key to this improvement: i)
modeling structure in the covariates, ii) significance testing using the
posterior probabilities of inclusion, and iii) model averaging. We present
results from applying this model to a large genomic dataset to demonstrate
computational tractability.

    <title>inPHAP: Interactive visualization of genotype and phased haplotype data</title>
    <summary>  Background: To understand individual genomes it is necessary to look at the
variations that lead to changes in phenotype and possibly to disease. However,
genotype information alone is often not sufficient and additional knowledge
regarding the phase of the variation is needed to make correct interpretations.
Interactive visualizations, that allow the user to explore the data in various
ways, can be of great assistance in the process of making well informed
decisions. But, currently there is a lack for visualizations that are able to
deal with phased haplotype data. Results: We present inPHAP, an interactive
visualization tool for genotype and phased haplotype data. inPHAP features a
variety of interaction possibilities such as zooming, sorting, filtering and
aggregation of rows in order to explore patterns hidden in large genetic data
sets. As a proof of concept, we apply inPHAP to the phased haplotype data set
of Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project. Thereby, inPHAP's ability to show
genetic variations on the population as well as on the individuals level is
demonstrated for several disease related loci. Conclusions: As of today, inPHAP
is the only visual analytical tool that allows the user to explore unphased and
phased haplotype data interactively. Due to its highly scalable design, inPHAP
can be applied to large datasets with up to 100 GB of data, enabling users to
visualize even large scale input data. inPHAP closes the gap between common
visualization tools for unphased genotype data and introduces several new
features, such as the visualization of phased data.

    <title>Phylogenetics and the human microbiome</title>
    <summary>  The human microbiome is the ensemble of genes in the microbes that live
inside and on the surface of humans. Because microbial sequencing information
is now much easier to come by than phenotypic information, there has been an
explosion of sequencing and genetic analysis of microbiome samples. Much of the
analytical work for these sequences involves phylogenetics, at least
indirectly, but methodology has developed in a somewhat different direction
than for other applications of phylogenetics. In this paper I review the field
and its methods from the perspective of a phylogeneticist, as well as
describing current challenges for phylogenetics coming from this type of work.

    <title>KMC 2: Fast and resource-frugal $k$-mer counting</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Building the histogram of occurrences of every $k$-symbol long
substring of nucleotide data is a standard step in many bioinformatics
applications, known under the name of $k$-mer counting. Its applications
include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence
alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast
algorithms for $k$-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory.
  Results: We present a novel method for $k$-mer counting, on large datasets at
least twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish~2, KMC~1), using
about 12\,GB (or less) of RAM memory. Our disk-based method bears some
resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with
signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using $(k,
x)$-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O, and a highly parallel overall
architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example,
KMC~2 allows to count the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold
coverage (106\,GB of compressed size) in about 20 minutes, on a 6-core Intel i7
PC with an SSD.

    <title>Statistical distributions and entropy considerations in gene codes</title>
    <summary>  In our paper selected linguistic features of genomes to study the statistics
of the gene codes are considered. We present the information theory from which
it follows that if the system is described by distributions of hyperbolic type
it leads to the possibility of entropy loss and stability. We show that the
histograms of gene lengths are similar to that of language words. We show the
correspondence between presented theory and results for the number of
replicated genes and replicated fragments of genes in genomes for Borelia
burgdorferi, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c.

    <title>Pervasive variation of transcription factor orthologs contributes to
  regulatory network evolution</title>
    <summary>  Differences in transcriptional regulatory networks underlie much of the
phenotypic variation observed across organisms. Changes to cis-regulatory
elements are widely believed to be the predominant means by which regulatory
networks evolve, yet examples of regulatory network divergence due to
transcription factor (TF) variation have also been observed. To systematically
ascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we
analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc
finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years
of evolution. Remarkably, we uncovered that a significant fraction of all
C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their
DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF
domains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~47% of domains shared
between D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging
DNA-contacting residues, found in ~66% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in
our analysis and corresponding to ~24% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs,
show evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across
phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same
variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D.
melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted
specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic
distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.
Further, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in
developmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional
enrichments. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely
unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and
other metazoans.

    <title>Maximizing Protein Translation Rate in the Ribosome Flow Model: the
  Homogeneous Case</title>
    <summary>  Gene translation is the process in which intracellular macro-molecules,
called ribosomes, decode genetic information in the mRNA chain into the
corresponding proteins. Gene translation includes several steps. During the
elongation step, ribosomes move along the mRNA in a sequential manner and link
amino-acids together in the corresponding order to produce the proteins.
  The homogeneous ribosome flow model(HRFM) is a deterministic computational
model for translation-elongation under the assumption of constant elongation
rates along the mRNA chain. The HRFM is described by a set of n first-order
nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where n represents the number of
sites along the mRNA chain. The HRFM also includes two positive parameters:
ribosomal initiation rate and the (constant) elongation rate. In this paper, we
show that the steady-state translation rate in the HRFM is a concave function
of its parameters. This means that the problem of determining the parameter
values that maximize the translation rate is relatively simple. Our results may
contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of
translation-elongation. We demonstrate this by using the theoretical results to
estimate the initiation rate in M. musculus embryonic stem cell. The underlying
assumption is that evolution optimized the translation mechanism.
  For the infinite-dimensional HRFM, we derive a closed-form solution to the
problem of determining the initiation and transition rates that maximize the
protein translation rate. We show that these expressions provide good
approximations for the optimal values in the n-dimensional HRFM already for
relatively small values of n. These results may have applications for synthetic
biology where an important problem is to re-engineer genomic systems in order
to maximize the protein production rate.

    <title>SEK: Sparsity exploiting $k$-mer-based estimation of bacterial community
  composition</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Estimation of bacterial community composition from a
high-throughput sequenced sample is an important task in metagenomics
applications. Since the sample sequence data typically harbors reads of
variable lengths and different levels of biological and technical noise,
accurate statistical analysis of such data is challenging. Currently popular
estimation methods are typically very time consuming in a desktop computing
environment.
  Results: Using sparsity enforcing methods from the general sparse signal
processing field (such as compressed sensing), we derive a solution to the
community composition estimation problem by a simultaneous assignment of all
sample reads to a pre-processed reference database. A general statistical model
based on kernel density estimation techniques is introduced for the assignment
task and the model solution is obtained using convex optimization tools.
Further, we design a greedy algorithm solution for a fast solution. Our
approach offers a reasonably fast community composition estimation method which
is shown to be more robust to input data variation than a recently introduced
related method.
  Availability: A platform-independent Matlab implementation of the method is
freely available at http://www.ee.kth.se/ctsoftware; source code that does not
require access to Matlab is currently being tested and will be made available
later through the above website.

    <title>Posterior predictive checks to quantify lack-of-fit in admixture models
  of latent population structure</title>
    <summary>  Admixture models are a ubiquitous approach to capture latent population
structure in genetic samples. Despite the widespread application of admixture
models, little thought has been devoted to the quality of the model fit or the
accuracy of the estimates of parameters of interest for a particular study.
Here we develop methods for validating admixture models based on posterior
predictive checks (PPCs), a Bayesian method for assessing the quality of a
statistical model. We develop PPCs for five population-level statistics of
interest: within-population genetic variation, background linkage
disequilibrium, number of ancestral populations, between-population genetic
variation, and the downstream use of admixture parameters to correct for
population structure in association studies. Using PPCs, we evaluate the
quality of the model estimates for four qualitatively different population
genetic data sets: the POPRES European individuals, the HapMap phase 3
individuals, continental Indians, and African American individuals. We found
that the same model fitted to different genomic studies resulted in highly
study-specific results when evaluated using PPCs, illustrating the utility of
PPCs for model-based analyses in large genomic studies.

    <title>Bayesian Analysis for miRNA and mRNA Interactions Using Expression Data</title>
    <summary>  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules composed of 19-22 nt, which play
important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by
inhibiting the translation of the mRNA into proteins or otherwise cleaving the
target mRNA. Inferring miRNA targets provides useful information for
understanding the roles of miRNA in biological processes that are potentially
involved in complex diseases. Statistical methodologies for point estimation,
such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm,
have been proposed to identify the interactions of miRNA and mRNA based on
sequence and expression data. In this paper, we propose using the Bayesian
LASSO (BLASSO) and the non-negative Bayesian LASSO (nBLASSO) to analyse the
interactions between miRNA and mRNA using expression data. The proposed
Bayesian methods explore the posterior distributions for those parameters
required to model the miRNA-mRNA interactions. These approaches can be used to
observe the inferred effects of the miRNAs on the targets by plotting the
posterior distributions of those parameters. For comparison purposes, the Least
Squares Regression (LSR), Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, non-negative LASSO
(nLASSO), and the proposed Bayesian approaches were applied to four public
datasets. We concluded that nLASSO and nBLASSO perform best in terms of
sensitivity and specificity. Compared to the point estimate algorithms, which
only provide single estimates for those parameters, the Bayesian methods are
more meaningful and provide credible intervals, which take into account the
uncertainty of the inferred interactions of the miRNA and mRNA. Furthermore,
Bayesian methods naturally provide statistical significance to select
convincing inferred interactions, while point estimate algorithms require a
manually chosen threshold, which is less meaningful, to choose the possible
interactions.

    <title>Conservation and losses of avian non-coding RNA loci</title>
    <summary>  Here we present the results of a large-scale bioinformatic annotation of
non-coding RNA loci in 48 avian genomes. Our approach uses probabilistic models
of hand-curated families from the Rfam database to infer conserved RNA families
within each avian genome. We supplement these annotations with predictions from
the tRNA annotation tool, tRNAscan-SE and microRNAs from miRBase. We show that
a number of lncRNA-associated loci are conserved between birds and mammals,
including several intriguing cases where the reported mammalian lncRNA function
is not conserved in birds. We also demonstrate extensive conservation of
classical ncRNAs (e.g., tRNAs) and more recently discovered ncRNAs (e.g.,
snoRNAs and miRNAs) in birds. Furthermore, we describe numerous "losses" of
several RNA families, and attribute these to genuine loss, divergence or
missing data. In particular, we show that many of these losses are due to the
challenges associated with assembling Avian microchromosomes. These combined
results illustrate the utility of applying homology-based methods for
annotating novel vertebrate genomes.

    <title>Application of the fractional stable distributions for approximation of
  gene expression profiles</title>
    <summary>  At the present time reliably established that probability density functions
of gene expression of microarray experiments possess a number of universal
properties. First of all these distributions have power asymptotic and secondly
the shape of these distributions are inherent for all organisms and tissues.
This fact led to appearance of a number works where authors are investigating
various probability distributions for approximation of empirical distributions
of gene expression. Nevertheless all these distributions aren't limit
distribution and aren't solution of any equations. These facts by our opinion
are essential shortcoming of these probability laws. Besides, expression of
individual gene aren't accidental event and it depends from expression other
genes. This allows to talk about existence of genic regulatory net in the cell.
In the work the class of fractional stable distributions (FSD) are described.
This class of distributions is limit distribution of sum independent identical
distributed random variables. These distributions have power-law asymptotic and
this fact allow us to apply their for approximation of experimental densities
gene expression of microarray experiments. The parameters of FSDs are
statistically estimated by experimental dates and empirical density is compared
whit theoretical density. In the work the algorithms of parameters estimation
and simulating of FSD variables are presented. The results of such comparison
allow to make conclusion that empirical densities of gene expression can be
approximate by FSD.

    <title>Assessing Technical Performance in Differential Gene Expression
  Experiments with External Spike-in RNA Control Ratio Mixtures</title>
    <summary>  There is a critical need for standard approaches to assess, report, and
compare the technical performance of genome-scale differential gene expression
experiments. We assess technical performance with a proposed "standard"
dashboard of metrics derived from analysis of external spike-in RNA control
ratio mixtures. These control ratio mixtures with defined abundance ratios
enable assessment of diagnostic performance of differentially expressed
transcript lists, limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates, and expression
ratio variability and measurement bias. The performance metrics suite is
applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these
metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An
interlaboratory study using identical samples shared amongst 12 laboratories
with three different measurement processes demonstrated generally consistent
diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias
were also comparable amongst laboratories for the same measurement process.
Different biases were observed for measurement processes using different mRNA
enrichment protocols.

    <title>Nanopore Sequencing of the phi X 174 genome</title>
    <summary>  Nanopore sequencing of DNA is a single-molecule technique that may achieve
long reads, low cost, and high speed with minimal sample preparation and
instrumentation. Here, we build on recent progress with respect to nanopore
resolution and DNA control to interpret the procession of ion current levels
observed during the translocation of DNA through the pore MspA. As
approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we
measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations
(quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of
previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174
genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500
bases in length that can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference
genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome
assembly and polymorphism detection. All methods and data are made fully
available.

    <title>BEETL-fastq: a searchable compressed archive for DNA reads</title>
    <summary>  Motivation:
  FASTQ is a standard file format for DNA sequencing data which stores both
nucleotides and quality scores. A typical sequencing study can easily generate
hundreds of gigabytes of FASTQ files, while public archives such as ENA and
NCBI and large international collaborations such as the Cancer Genome Atlas can
accumulate many terabytes of data in this format. Text compression tools such
as gzip are often employed to reduce the storage burden, but have the
disadvantage that the data must be decompressed before it can be used.
  Here we present BEETL-fastq, a tool that not only compresses FASTQ-formatted
DNA reads more compactly than gzip, but also permits rapid search for $k$-mer
queries within the archived sequences. Importantly, the full FASTQ record of
each matching read or read pair is returned, allowing the search results to be
piped directly to any of the many standard tools that accept FASTQ data as
input.
  Results:
  We show that 6.6 terabytes of human reads in FASTQ format can be transformed
into 1.7 terabytes of indexed files, from where we can search for 1, 10, 100,
1000, a million of 30-mers in respectively 3, 8, 14, 45 and 567 seconds plus 20
ms per output read. Useful applications of the search capability are
highlighted, including the genotyping of structural variant breakpoints and "in
silico pull-down" experiments in which only the reads that cover a region of
interest are selectively extracted for the purposes of variant calling or
visualization.

    <title>Genome disorder and breast cancer susceptibility</title>
    <summary>  Many common diseases have a complex genetic basis in which large numbers of
genetic variations combine with environmental and lifestyle factors to
determine risk. However, quantifying such polygenic effects and their
relationship to disease risk has been challenging. In order to address these
difficulties we developed a global measure of the information content of an
individual's genome relative to a reference population, which may be used to
assess differences in global genome structure between cases and appropriate
controls. Informally this measure, which we call relative genome information
(RGI), quantifies the relative "disorder" of an individual's genome. In order
to test its ability to predict disease risk we used RGI to compare single
nucleotide polymorphism genotypes from two independent samples of women with
early-onset breast cancer with three independent sets of controls. We found
that RGI was significantly elevated in both sets of breast cancer cases in
comparison with all three sets of controls, with disease risk rising sharply
with RGI (odds ratio greater than 12 for the highest percentile RGI).
Furthermore, we found that these differences are not due to associations with
common variants at a small number of disease-associated loci, but rather are
due to the combined associations of thousands of markers distributed throughout
the genome. Our results indicate that the information content of an
individual's genome may be used to measure the risk of a complex disease, and
suggest that early-onset breast cancer has a strongly polygenic basis.

    <title>In Silico Derivation of HLA-Specific Alloreactivity Potential from Whole
  Exome Sequencing of Stem Cell Transplant Donors and Recipients: Understanding
  the Quantitative Immuno-biology of Allogeneic Transplantation</title>
    <summary>  Donor T cell mediated graft vs. host effects may result from the aggregate
alloreactivity to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA) presented by the HLA
in each donor-recipient pair (DRP) undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT).
Whole exome sequencing has demonstrated extensive nucleotide sequence variation
in HLA-matched DRP. Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in
the GVH direction (polymorphisms present in recipient and absent in donor) were
identified in 4 HLA-matched related and 5 unrelated DRP. The nucleotide
sequence flanking each SNP was obtained utilizing the ANNOVAR software package.
All possible nonameric-peptides encoded by the non-synonymous SNP were then
interrogated in-silico for their likelihood to be presented by the HLA class I
molecules in individual DRP, using the Immune-Epitope Database (IEDB) SMM
algorithm. The IEDB-SMM algorithm predicted a median 18,396 peptides/DRP which
bound HLA with an IC50 of &lt;500nM, and 2254 peptides/DRP with an IC50 of &lt;50nM.
Unrelated donors generally had higher numbers of peptides presented by the HLA.
A similarly large library of presented peptides was identified when the data
was interrogated using the Net MHCPan algorithm. These peptides were uniformly
distributed in the various organ systems. The bioinformatic algorithm presented
here demonstrates that there may be a high level of minor histocompatibility
antigen variation in HLA-matched individuals, constituting an HLA-specific
alloreactivity potential. These data provide a possible explanation for how
relatively minor adjustments in GVHD prophylaxis yield relatively similar
outcomes in HLA matched and mismatched SCT recipients.

    <title>Extensive regulation of metabolism and growth during the cell division
  cycle</title>
    <summary>  Yeast cells grown in culture can spontaneously synchronize their respiration,
metabolism, gene expression and cell division. Such metabolic oscillations in
synchronized cultures reflect single-cell oscillations, but the relationship
between the oscillations in single cells and synchronized cultures is poorly
understood. To understand this relationship and the coordination between
metabolism and cell division, we collected and analyzed DNA-content,
gene-expression and physiological data, at hundreds of time-points, from
cultures metabolically-synchronized at different growth rates, carbon sources
and biomass densities. The data enabled us to extend and generalize an
ensemble-average-over-phases (EAP) model that connects the population-average
gene-expression of asynchronous cultures to the gene-expression dynamics in the
single-cells comprising the cultures. The extended model explains the
carbon-source specific growth-rate responses of hundreds of genes. Our data
demonstrate that for a given growth rate, the frequency of metabolic cycling in
synchronized cultures increases with the biomass density. This observation
underscores the difference between metabolic cycling in synchronized cultures
and in single cells and suggests entraining of the single-cell cycle by a
quorum-sensing mechanism. Constant levels of residual glucose during the
metabolic cycling of synchronized cultures indicate that storage carbohydrates
are required to fuel not only the G1/S transition of the division cycle but
also the metabolic cycle. Despite the large variation in profiled conditions
and in the time-scale of their dynamics, most genes preserve invariant dynamics
of coordination with each other and with the rate of oxygen consumption.
Similarly, the G1/S transition always occurs at the beginning, middle or end of
the high oxygen consumption phases, analogous to observations in human and
drosophila cells.

    <title>Scanning a Poisson Random Field for Local Signals</title>
    <summary>  The detection of local genomic signals using high-throughput DNA sequencing
data can be cast as a problem of scanning a Poisson random field for local
changes in the rate of the process. We propose a likelihood-based framework for
for such scans, and derive formulas for false positive rate control and power
calculations. The framework can also accommodate mixtures of Poisson processes
to deal with over-dispersion. As a specific, detailed example, we consider the
detection of insertions and deletions by paired-end DNA-sequencing. We propose
several statistics for this problem, compare their power under current
experimental designs, and illustrate their application on an Illumina Platinum
Genomes data set.

    <title>Identifying the Genetic Basis of Functional Protein Evolution Using
  Reconstructed Ancestors</title>
    <summary>  A central challenge in the study of protein evolution is the identification
of historic amino acid sequence changes responsible for creating novel
functions observed in present-day proteins. To address this problem, we
developed a new method to identify and rank amino acid mutations in ancestral
protein sequences according to their function-shifting potential. Our approach
scans the changes between two reconstructed ancestral sequences in order to
find (1) sites with sequence changes that significantly deviate from our
model-based probabilistic expectations, (2) sites that demonstrate extreme
changes in mutual information, and (3) sites with extreme gains or losses of
information content. By taking the overlaps of these statistical signals, the
method accurately identifies cryptic evolutionary patterns that are often not
obvious when examining only the conservation of modern-day protein sequences.
We validated this method with a training set of previously-discovered
function-shifting mutations in three essential protein families in animals and
fungi, whose evolutionary histories were the prior subject of systematic
molecular biological investigation. Our method identified the known
function-shifting mutations in the training set with a very low rate of false
positive discovery. Further, our approach significantly outperformed other
methods that use variability in evolutionary rates to detect functional loci.
The accuracy of our approach indicates it could be a useful tool for generating
specific testable hypotheses regarding the acquisition of new functions across
a wide range of protein families.

    <title>A brain-wide association study of DISC1 genetic variants reveals a
  relationship with the structure and functional connectivity of the precuneus
  in schizophrenia</title>
    <summary>  The Disrupted in Schizophrenia Gene 1 (DISC1) plays a role in both neural
signalling and development and is associated with schizophrenia, although its
links to altered brain structure and function in this disorder are not fully
established. Here we have used structural and functional MRI to investigate
links with six DISC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We employed a
brain-wide association analysis (BWAS) together with a Jacknife internal
validation approach in 46 schizophrenia patients and 24 matched healthy control
subjects. Results from structural MRI showed significant associations between
all six DISC1 variants and gray matter volume in the precuneus, post-central
gyrus and middle cingulate gyrus. Associations with specific SNPs were found
for rs2738880 in the left precuneus and right post-central gyrus, and rs1535530
in the right precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus. Using regions showing
structural associations as seeds a resting-state functional connectivity
analysis revealed significant associations between all 6 SNPS and connectivity
between the right precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus. The connection between
the right precuneus and inferior frontal gyrus was also specifically associated
with rs821617. Importantly schizophrenia patients showed positive correlations
between the six DISC-1 SNPs associated gray matter volume in the left precuneus
and right post-central gyrus and negative symptom severity. No correlations
with illness duration were found. Our results provide the first evidence
suggesting a key role for structural and functional connectivity associations
between DISC1 polymorphisms and the precuneus in schizophrenia.

    <title>Characterizing Scales of Genetic Recombination and Antibiotic Resistance
  in Pathogenic Bacteria Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Pathogenic bacteria present a large disease burden on human health. Control
of these pathogens is hampered by rampant lateral gene transfer, whereby
pathogenic strains may acquire genes conferring resistance to common
antibiotics. Here we introduce tools from topological data analysis to
characterize the frequency and scale of lateral gene transfer in bacteria,
focusing on a set of pathogens of significant public health relevance. As a
case study, we examine the spread of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus
aureus. Finally, we consider the possible role of the human microbiome as a
reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes.

    <title>A5-miseq: an updated pipeline to assemble microbial genomes from
  Illumina MiSeq data</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Open-source bacterial genome assembly remains inaccessible to
many biologists due to its complexity. Few software solutions exist that are
capable of automating all steps in the process of de novo genome assembly from
Illumina data.
  Results: A5-miseq can produce high quality microbial genome assemblies from
as little as 20-fold sequence data coverage on a laptop computer without any
parameter tuning. A5-miseq does this by automating the process of adapter
trimming, quality filtering, error correction, contig and scaffold generation,
and detection of misassemblies. Unlike the original A5 pipeline, A5-miseq can
use long reads from the Illumina MiSeq, use read pairing information during
contig generation, and includes several improvements to read trimming. Together
these changes result in substantially improved assemblies that recover a more
complete set of reference genes than previous methods.
  Availability: A5-miseq is licensed under the GPL open source license. Source
code and precompiled binaries for Mac OS X 10.6+ and Linux 2.6.15+ are

    <title>Fast construction of FM-index for long sequence reads</title>
    <summary>  Summary: We present a new method to incrementally construct the FM-index for
both short and long sequence reads, up to the size of a genome. It is the first
algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in
the reverse (complement) lexicographical order without a separate sorting step.
The implementation is among the fastest for indexing short reads and the only
one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length.

    <title>Convex Total Least Squares</title>
    <summary>  We study the total least squares (TLS) problem that generalizes least squares
regression by allowing measurement errors in both dependent and independent
variables. TLS is widely used in applied fields including computer vision,
system identification and econometrics. The special case when all dependent and
independent variables have the same level of uncorrelated Gaussian noise, known
as ordinary TLS, can be solved by singular value decomposition (SVD). However,
SVD cannot solve many important practical TLS problems with realistic noise
structure, such as having varying measurement noise, known structure on the
errors, or large outliers requiring robust error-norms. To solve such problems,
we develop convex relaxation approaches for a general class of structured TLS
(STLS). We show both theoretically and experimentally, that while the plain
nuclear norm relaxation incurs large approximation errors for STLS, the
re-weighted nuclear norm approach is very effective, and achieves better
accuracy on challenging STLS problems than popular non-convex solvers. We
describe a fast solution based on augmented Lagrangian formulation, and apply
our approach to an important class of biological problems that use population
average measurements to infer cell-type and physiological-state specific
expression levels that are very hard to measure directly.

    <title>Uncovering Proximity of Chromosome Territories using Classical Algebraic
  Statistics</title>
    <summary>  Exchange type chromosome aberrations (ETCAs) are rearrangements of the genome
that occur when chromosomes break and the resulting fragments rejoin with other
fragments from other chromosomes. ETCAs are commonly observed in cancer cells
and in cells exposed to radiation. The frequency of these chromosome
rearrangements is correlated with their spatial proximity, therefore it can be
used to infer the three dimensional organization of the genome. Extracting
statistical significance of spatial proximity from cancer and radiation data
has remained somewhat elusive because of the sparsity of the data. We here
propose a new approach to study the three dimensional organization of the
genome using algebraic statistics. We test our method on a published data set
of irradiated human blood lymphocyte cells. We provide a rigorous method for
testing the overall organization of the genome, and in agreement with previous
results we find a random relative positioning of chromosomes with the exception
of the chromosome pairs \{1,22\} and \{13,14\} that have a significantly larger
number of ETCAs than the rest of the chromosome pairs suggesting their spatial
proximity. We conclude that algebraic methods can successfully be used to
analyze genetic data and have potential applications to larger and more complex
data sets.

    <title>High-resolution transcriptome analysis with long-read RNA sequencing</title>
    <summary>  RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables characterization and quantification of
individual transcriptomes as well as detection of patterns of allelic
expression and alternative splicing. Current RNA-seq protocols depend on
high-throughput short-read sequencing of cDNA. However, as ongoing advances are
rapidly yielding increasing read lengths, a technical hurdle remains in
identifying the degree to which differences in read length influence various
transcriptome analyses. In this study, we generated two paired-end RNA-seq
datasets of differing read lengths (2x75 bp and 2x262 bp) for lymphoblastoid
cell line GM12878 and compared the effect of read length on transcriptome
analyses, including read-mapping performance, gene and transcript
quantification, and detection of allele-specific expression (ASE) and
allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) patterns. Our results indicate
that, while the current long-read protocol is considerably more expensive than
short-read sequencing, there are important benefits that can only be achieved
with longer read length, including lower mapping bias and reduced ambiguity in
assigning reads to genomic elements, such as mRNA transcript. We show that
these benefits ultimately lead to improved detection of cis-acting regulatory
and splicing variation effects within individuals.

    <title>The relationships among GC content, nucleosome occupancy, and exon size</title>
    <summary>  The average size of internal translated exons, ranging from 120 to 165 nt
across metazoans, is approximately the size of the typical mononucleosome (147
nt). Genome-wide study has also shown that nucleosome occupancy is
significantly higher in exons than in introns, which might indicate that the
evolution of exon size is related to its nucleosome occupancy. By grouping
exons by the GC contents of their flanking introns, we show that the average
exon size is positively correlated with its GC content. Using the sequencing
data from direct mapping of Homo sapiens nucleosomes with limited nuclease
digestion, we show that the level of nucleosome occupancy is also positively
correlated with the exon GC content in a similar fashion. We then demonstrated
that exon size is positively correlated with their nucleosome occupancy. The
strong correlation between exon size and the nucleosome occupancy suggests that
chromatin organization may be related to the evolution of exon sizes.

    <title>Functional architecture of Escherichia coli: new insights provided by a
  natural decomposition approach</title>
    <summary>  Background: Previous studies have used different methods in an effort to
extract the modular organization of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs).
However, these approaches are not natural, as they try to cluster highly
connected genes into a module or locate known pleiotropic transcription factors
in lower hierarchical layers. Here, we unravel the TRN of Escherichia coli by
separating it into its key elements, thus revealing its natural organization.
We also present a mathematical criterion, based on the topological features of
the TRN, to classify the network elements into one of two possible classes:
hierarchical or modular genes.
  Results: We found that modular genes are clustered into physiologically
correlated groups validated by a statistical analysis of the enrichment of the
functional classes. Hierarchical genes encode transcription factors responsible
for coordinating module responses based on general interest signals.
Hierarchical elements correlate highly with the previously studied global
regulators, suggesting that this could be the first mathematical method to
identify global regulators. We identified a new element in TRNs never described
before: intermodular genes. These are structural genes that integrate, at the
promoter level, signals coming from different modules, and therefore from
different physiological responses. Using the concept of pleiotropy, we have
reconstructed the hierarchy of the network and discuss the role of feedforward
motifs in shaping the hierarchical backbone of the TRN.
  Conclusions: This study sheds new light on the design principles underpinning
the organization of TRNs, showing a novel nonpyramidal architecture composed of
independent modules globally governed by hierarchical transcription factors,
whose responses are integrated by intermodular genes.

    <title>Prokaryotic regulatory systems biology: Common principles governing the
  functional architectures of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli unveiled
  by the natural decomposition approach</title>
    <summary>  Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are two of the best-studied
prokaryotic model organisms. Previous analyses of their transcriptional
regulatory networks have shown that they exhibit high plasticity during
evolution and suggested that both converge to scale-free-like structures.
Nevertheless, beyond this suggestion, no analyses have been carried out to
identify the common systems-level components and principles governing these
organisms. Here we show that these two phylogenetically distant organisms
follow a set of common novel biologically consistent systems principles
revealed by the mathematically and biologically founded natural decomposition
approach. The discovered common functional architecture is a diamond-shaped,
matryoshka-like, three-layer (coordination, processing, and integration)
hierarchy exhibiting feedback, which is shaped by four systems-level
components: global transcription factors (global TFs), locally autonomous
modules, basal machinery and intermodular genes. The first mathematical
criterion to identify global TFs, the $\kappa$-value, was reassessed on B.
subtilis and confirmed its high predictive power by identifying all the
previously reported, plus three potential, master regulators and eight sigma
factors. The functional conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a
set of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified
via both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions. This study
reveals novel common systems principles maintained between two phylogenetically
distant organisms and provides a comparison of their lifestyle adaptations. Our
results shed new light on the systems-level principles and the fundamental
functions required by bacteria to sustain life.

    <title>Evidence for strong co-evolution of mitochondrial and somatic genomes</title>
    <summary>  We studied a relations between the triplet frequency composition of
mitochondria genomes, and the phylogeny of their bearers. First, the clusters
in 63dimensional space were developed due to $K$-means. Second, the clade
composition of those clusters has been studied. It was found that genomes are
distributed among the clusters very regularly, with strong correlation to
taxonomy. Strong co-evolution manifests through this correlation: the proximity
in frequency space was determined over the mitochondrion genomes, while the
proximity in taxonomy was determined morphologically.

    <title>Long non-coding RNAs as a source of new peptides</title>
    <summary>  Deep transcriptome sequencing has revealed the existence of many transcripts
that lack long or conserved open reading frames and which have been termed long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Despite the existence of several well-characterized
lncRNAs that play roles in the regulation of gene expression, the vast majority
of them do not yet have a known function. Motivated by the existence of
ribosome profiling data for several species, we have tested the hypothesis that
they may act as a repository for the synthesis of new peptides using data from
human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, Arabidopsis and yeast. The ribosome
protection patterns are consistent with the presence of translated open reading
frames (ORFs) in a very large number of lncRNAs. Most of the ribosome-protected
ORFs are shorter than 100 amino acids and usually cover less than half the
transcript. Ribosome density in these ORFs is high and contrasts sharply with
the 3UTR region, in which very often there is no detectable ribosome binding,
similar to bona fide protein-coding genes. The coding potential of
ribosome-protected ORFs, measured using hexamer frequencies, is significantly
higher than that of randomly selected intronic ORFs and similar to that of
evolutionary young coding sequences. Selective constraints in
ribosome-protected ORFs from lncRNAs are lower than in typical protein-coding
genes but again similar to young proteins. These results strongly suggest that
lncRNAs play an important role in de novo protein evolution.

    <title>Spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE)</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Gene set testing is typically performed in a supervised context
to quantify the association between groups of genes and a clinical phenotype.
In many cases, however, a gene set-based interpretation of genomic data is
desired in the absence of a phenotype variable. Although methods exist for
unsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative
to clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the
clustering algorithm and number of clusters. Results: We propose a novel
method, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive
testing of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE
first computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal
components (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE)
method. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the
spectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level
p-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled
by Tracey-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE
algorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To
illustrate the utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior
performance of the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques
for testing the association between MSigDB gene sets and the variance structure
of microarray gene expression data. Availability:

    <title>Fast and accurate alignment of long bisulfite-seq reads</title>
    <summary>  Summary: Longer sequencing reads, with at least 200 bases per template are
now common. While traditional aligners have adopted new strategies to improve
the mapping of longer reads, aligners specific to bisulfite-sequencing were
optimized when much shorter reads were the norm. We sought to perform the first
comparison using longer reads to determine which aligners were most accurate

    <title>A Unifying Model of Genome Evolution Under Parsimony</title>
    <summary>  We present a data structure called a history graph that offers a practical
basis for the analysis of genome evolution. It conceptually simplifies the
study of parsimonious evolutionary histories by representing both substitutions
and double cut and join (DCJ) rearrangements in the presence of duplications.
The problem of constructing parsimonious history graphs thus subsumes related
maximum parsimony problems in the fields of phylogenetic reconstruction and
genome rearrangement. We show that tractable functions can be used to define
upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of substitutions and DCJ
rearrangements needed to explain any history graph. These bounds become tight
for a special type of unambiguous history graph called an ancestral variation
graph (AVG), which constrains in its combinatorial structure the number of
operations required. We finally demonstrate that for a given history graph $G$,
a finite set of AVGs describe all parsimonious interpretations of $G$, and this
set can be explored with a few sampling moves.

    <title>The evolution of tyrosine-recombinase elements in Nematoda</title>
    <summary>  Transposable elements can be categorised into DNA and RNA elements based on
their mechanism of transposition. Tyrosine recombinase elements (YREs) are
relatively rare and poorly understood, despite sharing characteristics with
both DNA and RNA elements. Previously, the Nematoda have been reported to have
a substantially different diversity of YREs compared to other animal phyla: the
Dirs1-like YRE retrotransposon was encountered in most animal phyla but not in
Nematoda, and a unique Pat1-like YRE retrotransposon has only been recorded
from Nematoda. We explored the diversity of YREs in Nematoda by sampling
broadly across the phylum and including 34 genomes representing the three
classes within Nematoda. We developed a method to isolate and classify YREs
based on both feature organization and phylogenetic relationships in an open
and reproducible workflow. We also ensured that our phylogenetic approach to
YRE classification identified truncated and degenerate elements, informatively
increasing the number of elements sampled. We identified Dirs1-like elements
(thought to be absent from Nematoda) in the nematode classes Enoplia and
Dorylaimia indicating that nematode model species do not adequately represent
the diversity of transposable elements in the phylum. Nematode Pat1-like
elements were found to be a derived form of another pat1-like element that is
present more widely in animals. Several sequence features used widely for the
classification of YREs were found to be homoplasious, highlighting the need for
a phylogenetically-based classification scheme. Nematode model species do not
represent the diversity of transposable elements in the phylum.

    <title>Application of compressed sensing to genome wide association studies and
  genomic selection</title>
    <summary>  We show that the signal-processing paradigm known as compressed sensing (CS)
is applicable to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection
(GS). The aim of GWAS is to isolate trait-associated loci, whereas GS attempts
to predict the phenotypic values of new individuals on the basis of training
data. CS addresses a problem common to both endeavors, namely that the number
of genotyped markers often greatly exceeds the sample size. We show using CS
methods and theory that all loci of nonzero effect can be identified (selected)
using an efficient algorithm, provided that they are sufficiently few in number
(sparse) relative to sample size. For heritability h2 = 1, there is a sharp
phase transition to complete selection as the sample size is increased. For
heritability values less than one, complete selection can still occur although
the transition is smoothed. The transition boundary is only weakly dependent on
the total number of genotyped markers. The crossing of a transition boundary
provides an objective means to determine when true effects are being recovered;
we discuss practical methods for detecting the boundary. For h2 = 0.5, we find
that a sample size that is thirty times the number of nonzero loci is
sufficient for good recovery.

    <title>Quantifying evolutionary dynamics of the basic genome of E. coli</title>
    <summary>  The ~4-Mbp basic genome shared by 32 independent isolates of E. coli
representing considerable population diversity has been approximated by
whole-genome multiple-alignment and computational filtering designed to remove
mobile elements and highly variable regions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the 496 basic-genome pairs are identified and clonally inherited
stretches are distinguished from those acquired by horizontal transfer (HT) by
sharp discontinuities in SNP density. The six least diverged genome-pairs each
have only one or two HT stretches, each occupying 42-115-kbp of basic genome
and containing at least one gene cluster known to confer selective advantage.
At higher divergences, the typical mosaic pattern of interspersed clonal and HT
stretches across the entire basic genome are observed, including likely
fragmented integrations across a restriction barrier. A simple model suggests
that individual HT events are of the order of 10-kbp and are the chief
contributor to genome divergence, bringing in almost 12 times more SNPs than
point mutations. As a result of continuing horizontal transfer of such large
segments, 400 out of the 496 strain-pairs beyond genomic divergence of share
virtually no genomic material with their common ancestor. We conclude that the
active and continuing horizontal transfer of moderately large genomic fragments
is likely to be mediated primarily by a co evolving population of phages that
distribute random genome fragments throughout the population by generalized
transduction, allowing efficient adaptation to environmental changes.

    <title>Change Point Analysis of Histone Modifications Reveals Epigenetic Blocks
  Linking to Physical Domains</title>
    <summary>  Histone modification is a vital epigenetic mechanism for transcriptional
control in eukaryotes. High-throughput techniques have enabled whole-genome
analysis of histone modifications in recent years. However, most studies assume
one combination of histone modification invariantly translates to one
transcriptional output regardless of local chromatin environment. In this study
we hypothesize that, the genome is organized into local domains that manifest
similar enrichment pattern of histone modification, which leads to orchestrated
regulation of expression of genes with relevant bio- logical functions. We
propose a multivariate Bayesian Change Point (BCP) model to segment the
Drosophila melanogaster genome into consecutive blocks on the basis of
combinatorial patterns of histone marks. By modeling the sparse distribution of
histone marks across the chromosome with a zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, our
partitions capture local BLOCKs that manifest relatively homogeneous enrichment
pattern of histone modifications. We further characterized BLOCKs by their
transcription levels, distribution of genes, degree of co-regulation and GO
enrichment. Our results demonstrate that these BLOCKs, although inferred merely
from histone modifications, reveal strong relevance with physical domains,
which suggest their important roles in chromatin organization and coordinated
gene regulation.

    <title>Patterns of positive selection in seven ant genomes</title>
    <summary>  The evolution of ants is marked by remarkable adaptations that allowed the
development of very complex social systems. To identify how ant-specific
adaptations are associated with patterns of molecular evolution, we searched
for signs of positive selection on amino-acid changes in proteins. We
identified 24 functional categories of genes which were enriched for positively
selected genes in the ant lineage. We also reanalyzed genome-wide datasets in
bees and flies with the same methodology, to check whether positive selection
was specific to ants or also present in other insects. Notably, genes
implicated in immunity were enriched for positively selected genes in the three
lineages, ruling out the hypothesis that the evolution of hygienic behaviors in
social insects caused a major relaxation of selective pressure on immune genes.
Our scan also indicated that genes implicated in neurogenesis and olfaction
started to undergo increased positive selection before the evolution of
sociality in Hymenoptera. Finally, the comparison between these three lineages
allowed us to pinpoint molecular evolution patterns that were specific to the
ant lineage. In particular, there was ant-specific recurrent positive selection
on genes with mitochondrial functions, suggesting that mitochondrial activity
was improved during the evolution of this lineage. This might have been an
important step toward the evolution of extreme lifespan that is a hallmark of
ants.

    <title>Identification of structural features in chemicals associated with
  cancer drug response: A systematic data-driven analysis</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological
response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug effects, and
for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug thera-pies. New methods are
required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of
drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.
Results: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis
on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on ge-nome-wide gene expression
across several cancer cell lines (CMap database). The task is formulated as
searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared
effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The
com-ponents can be computed with an extension of a very recent ap-proach called
Group Factor Analysis (GFA). We identify 11 compo-nents that link the
structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses
observed in the three cell lines, and identify structural groups that may be
responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the
limited earlier studies on CMap and identifies both the previously reported
associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account
multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel
observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by
15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D
descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific
anti-inflammatory response, resem-bling the effects of corticosteroids.

    <title>Graph-based data integration predicts long-range regulatory interactions
  across the human genome</title>
    <summary>  Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is one of the main processes
that affect cell diversification from a single set of genes. Regulatory
proteins often interact with DNA regions located distally from the
transcription start sites (TSS) of the genes. We developed a computational
method that combines open chromatin and gene expression information for a large
number of cell types to identify these distal regulatory elements. Our method
builds correlation graphs for publicly available DNase-seq and exon array
datasets with matching samples and uses graph-based methods to filter findings
supported by multiple datasets and remove indirect interactions. The resulting
set of interactions was validated with both anecdotal information of known
long-range interactions and unbiased experimental data deduced from Hi-C and
CAGE experiments. Our results provide a novel set of high-confidence candidate
open chromatin regions involved in gene regulation, often located several Mb
away from the TSS of their target gene.

    <title>Ensemble Analysis of Adaptive Compressed Genome Sequencing Strategies</title>
    <summary>  Acquiring genomes at single-cell resolution has many applications such as in
the study of microbiota. However, deep sequencing and assembly of all of
millions of cells in a sample is prohibitively costly. A property that can come
to rescue is that deep sequencing of every cell should not be necessary to
capture all distinct genomes, as the majority of cells are biological
replicates. Biologically important samples are often sparse in that sense. In
this paper, we propose an adaptive compressed method, also known as distilled
sensing, to capture all distinct genomes in a sparse microbial community with
reduced sequencing effort. As opposed to group testing in which the number of
distinct events is often constant and sparsity is equivalent to rarity of an
event, sparsity in our case means scarcity of distinct events in comparison to
the data size. Previously, we introduced the problem and proposed a distilled
sensing solution based on the breadth first search strategy. We simulated the
whole process which constrained our ability to study the behavior of the
algorithm for the entire ensemble due to its computational intensity. In this
paper, we modify our previous breadth first search strategy and introduce the
depth first search strategy. Instead of simulating the entire process, which is
intractable for a large number of experiments, we provide a dynamic programming
algorithm to analyze the behavior of the method for the entire ensemble. The
ensemble analysis algorithm recursively calculates the probability of capturing
every distinct genome and also the expected total sequenced nucleotides for a
given population profile. Our results suggest that the expected total sequenced
nucleotides grows proportional to $\log$ of the number of cells and
proportional linearly with the number of distinct genomes.

    <title>When is Menzerath-Altmann law mathematically trivial? A new approach</title>
    <summary>  Menzerath's law, the tendency of Z, the mean size of the parts, to decrease
as X, the number of parts, increases is found in language, music and genomes.
Recently, it has been argued that the presence of the law in genomes is an
inevitable consequence of the fact that Z = Y/X, which would imply that Z
scales with X as Z ~ 1/X. That scaling is a very particular case of
Menzerath-Altmann law that has been rejected by means of a correlation test
between X and Y in genomes, being X the number of chromosomes of a species, Y
its genome size in bases and Z the mean chromosome size. Here we review the
statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests
based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if
Z ~ 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric based upon
the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z ~ 1/X in nine out of eleven
taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group. Rather than a fact, Z ~ 1/X is
a baseline that real genomes do not meet. The view of Menzerath-Altmann law as
inevitable is seriously flawed.

    <title>Landscape of standing variation for tandem duplications in Drosophila
  yakuba and Drosophila simulans</title>
    <summary>  We have used whole genome paired-end Illumina sequence data to identify
tandem duplications in 20 isofemale lines of D. yakuba, and 20 isofemale lines
of D. simulans and performed genome wide validation with PacBio long molecule
sequencing. We identify 1,415 tandem duplications that are segregating in D.
yakuba as well as 975 duplications in D. simulans, indicating greater variation
in D. yakuba. Additionally, we observe high rates of secondary deletions at
duplicated sites, with 8% of duplicated sites in D. simulans and 17% of sites
in D. yakuba modified with deletions. These secondary deletions are consistent
with the action of the large loop mismatch repair system acting to remove
polymorphic tandem duplication, resulting in rapid dynamics of gain and loss in
duplicated alleles and a richer substrate of genetic novelty than has been
previously reported. Most duplications are present in only single strains,
suggesting deleterious impacts are common. D. simulans shows larger numbers of
whole gene duplications in comparison to larger proportions of gene fragments
in D. yakuba. D. simulans displays an excess of high frequency variants on the
X chromosome, consistent with adaptive evolution through duplications on the D.
simulans X or demographic forces driving duplicates to high frequency. We
identify 78 chimeric genes in D. yakuba and 38 chimeric genes in D. simulans,
as well as 143 cases of recruited non-coding sequence in D. yakuba and 96 in D.
simulans, in agreement with rates of chimeric gene origination in D.
melanogaster. Together, these results suggest that tandem duplications often
result in complex variation beyond whole gene duplications that offers a rich
substrate of standing variation that is likely to contribute both to
detrimental phenotypes and disease, as well as to adaptive evolutionary change.

    <title>kdetrees: Nonparametric Estimation of Phylogenetic Tree Distributions</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: While the majority of gene histories found in a clade of
organisms are expected to be generated by a common process (e.g. the coalescent
process), it is well-known that numerous other coexisting processes (e.g.
horizontal gene transfers, gene duplication and subsequent
neofunctionalization) will cause some genes to exhibit a history quite distinct
from those of the majority of genes. Such "outlying" gene trees are considered
to be biologically interesting and identifying these genes has become an
important problem in phylogenetics.
  Results: We propose and implement KDETREES, a nonparametric method of
estimating distributions of phylogenetic trees, with the goal of identifying
trees which are significantly different from the rest of the trees in the
sample. Our method compares favorably with a similar recently-published method,
featuring an improvement of one polynomial order of computational complexity
(to quadratic in the number of trees analyzed), with simulation studies
suggesting only a small penalty to classification accuracy. Application of
KDETREES to a set of Apicomplexa genes identified several unreliable sequence
alignments which had escaped previous detection, as well as a gene
independently reported as a possible case of horizontal gene transfer. We also
analyze a set of Epichloe genes, fungi symbiotic with grasses, successfully
identifying a contrived instance of paralogy.
  Availability: Our method for estimating tree distributions and identifying
outlying trees is implemented as the R package KDETREES, and is available for
download from CRAN.

    <title>Molecular techniques to characterize the invA genes of Salmonella spp.
  for pathogen inactivation study in composting</title>
    <summary>  The relatively low concentration of pathogen indicators, such Salmonella, in
composting sometimes causes a problem with detection when using the
conventional techniques. The presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC)
organisms is also a potential problem with Salmonella detection when using
conventional techniques. In this study, the molecular approach for organism
recognition, known as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), was used for
characterisation the Salmonella spp. used as inoculums in composting. This
study also provides a better understand about selecting the suitable primer for
Salmonella spp. The specificity of the probes and primers at the species level
were verified by performing NCBI-BLAST2 (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool).
Primers that target the invA gene for Salmonella were selected which produce
fragment lengths around 285bp (shown in Figure 1). The Salmonella spp.
solutions were tested and proved contained the sequences of invA gene by using
several steps of molecular techniques before used it as inoculums in
composting. The laboratory scale batch composting reactors were used to examine
the inactivation of Salmonella spp. The inoculate solution of Salmonella was
prepared by culturing Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC13076) in tryptone broth
solution for 24 hours before adding it directly into the compost material. The
reduction rate of Salmonella spp. was enumerated by conventional method
accordingly to the standard compost guidelines (Figure 2). The laboratory scale
study showed that after composting for 8 days the numbers of Salmonella spp.
were below the limits in the UK compost standard (PAS 100) which requires the
compost to be free of Salmonella spp.

    <title>Mapping to a Reference Genome Structure</title>
    <summary>  To support comparative genomics, population genetics, and medical genetics,
we propose that a reference genome should come with a scheme for mapping each
base in any DNA string to a position in that reference genome. We refer to a
collection of one or more reference genomes and a scheme for mapping to their
positions as a reference structure. Here we describe the desirable properties
of reference structures and give examples. To account for natural genetic
variation, we consider the more general case in which a reference genome is
represented by a graph rather than a set of phased chromosomes; the latter is
treated as a special case.

    <title>Quantifying selection in immune receptor repertoires</title>
    <summary>  The efficient recognition of pathogens by the adaptive immune system relies
on the diversity of receptors displayed at the surface of immune cells. T-cell
receptor diversity results from an initial random DNA editing process, called
VDJ recombination, followed by functional selection of cells according to the
interaction of their surface receptors with self and foreign antigenic
peptides. To quantify the effect of selection on the highly variable elements
of the receptor, we apply a probabilistic maximum likelihood approach to the
analysis of high-throughput sequence data from the $\beta$-chain of human
T-cell receptors. We quantify selection factors for V and J gene choice, and
for the length and amino-acid composition of the variable region. Our approach
is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in
the recombination process. Inferred selection factors differ little between
donors, or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared
between donors is well-predicted by the model, indicating a purely stochastic
origin of such "public" sequences. We find a significant correlation between
biases induced by VDJ recombination and our inferred selection factors,
together with a reduction of diversity during selection. Both effects suggest
that natural selection acting on the recombination process has anticipated the
selection pressures experienced during somatic evolution.

    <title>VSEAMS: A pipeline for variant set enrichment analysis using summary
  GWAS data identifies IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA as key transcription factors in
  type 1 diabetes</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci
implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of GWAS summary statistics (p
values) and functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms.
Results: We describe the extension of a previously described non-parametric
method to test whether GWAS signals are enriched in functionally defined loci
to a situation where only GWAS p values are available. The approach is
implemented in VSEAMS, a freely available software pipeline. We use VSEAMS to
integrate functional gene sets defined via transcription factor knock down
experiments with GWAS results for type 1 diabetes and find variant set
enrichment in gene sets associated with IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a
known T1D susceptibility region, whilst BATF and ESRRA overlap other immune
disease susceptibility regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel
avenues of research for type 1 diabetes. Availability and implementation:
VSEAMS is available for download http://github.com/ollyburren/vseams.

    <title>Bayesian Neural Networks for Genetic Association Studies of Complex
  Disease</title>
    <summary>  Discovering causal genetic variants from large genetic association studies
poses many difficult challenges. Assessing which genetic markers are involved
in determining trait status is a computationally demanding task, especially in
the presence of gene-gene interactions. A non-parametric Bayesian approach in
the form of a Bayesian neural network is proposed for use in analyzing genetic
association studies. Demonstrations on synthetic and real data reveal they are
able to efficiently and accurately determine which variants are involved in
determining case-control status. Using graphics processing units (GPUs) the
time needed to build these models is decreased by several orders of magnitude.
In comparison with commonly used approaches for detecting genetic interactions,
Bayesian neural networks perform very well across a broad spectrum of possible
genetic relationships while having the computational efficiency needed to
handle large datasets.

    <title>Genetic Influences on Brain Gene Expression in Rats Selected for
  Tameness and Aggression</title>
    <summary>  Inter-individual differences in many behaviors are partly due to genetic
differences, but the identification of the genes and variants that influence
behavior remains challenging. Here, we studied an F2 intercross of two outbred
lines of rats selected for tame and aggressive behavior towards humans for more
than 64 generations. By using a mapping approach that is able to identify
genetic loci segregating within the lines, we identified four times more loci
influencing tameness and aggression than by an approach that assumes fixation
of causative alleles, suggesting that many causative loci were not driven to
fixation by the selection. We used RNA sequencing in 150 F2 animals to identify
hundreds of loci that influence brain gene expression. Several of these loci
colocalize with tameness loci and may reflect the same genetic variants.
Through analyses of correlations between allele effects on behavior and gene
expression, differential expression between the tame and aggressive rat
selection lines, and correlations between gene expression and tameness in F2
animals, we identify the genes Gltscr2, Lgi4, Zfp40 and Slc17a7 as candidate
contributors to the strikingly different behavior of the tame and aggressive
animals.

    <title>Thesis: The Effects of Hypoxia, Metabolic Restriction and Magnetic
  Fields on Chromosome Instability and Karyotype Contraction in Cancer Cell
  Lines</title>
    <summary>  Background: Biological effects of extra-low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields
(MFs) have lacked a credible mechanism of interaction between MFs and living
material. Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells.
Methods: Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of
0.025-5 microTesla, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6
days. Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a
mostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising
return to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF
increases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions
(KCs). Our data suggest that the KCs are caused by MF interference with
mitochondria's adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPS), compensated by the
action of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The effects
of MFs are similar to those of the ATPS inhibitor, oligomycin. They are
amplified by metformin, an AMPK stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK
inhibitor. Over environmental MFs, KCs of various cancer cell lines show
exceptionally wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythroleukemia
cells, which display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microTesla.
Conclusions: The biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in
the structure of water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These
results may be environment ally important, in view of the central roles played
in human physiology by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes,
cancer and longevity.

    <title>Modeling DNA methylation dynamics with approaches from phylogenetics</title>
    <summary>  Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is a prevalent epigenetic modification that
is required for proper development in vertebrates, and changes in CpG
methylation are essential to cellular differentiation. Genome-wide DNA
methylation assays have become increasingly common, and recently distinct
stages across differentiating cellular lineages have been assayed. How- ever,
current methods for modeling methylation dynamics do not account for the
dependency structure between precursor and dependent cell types. We developed a
continuous-time Markov chain approach, based on the observation that changes in
methylation state over tissue differentiation can be modeled similarly to DNA
nucleotide changes over evolutionary time. This model explicitly takes
precursor to descendant relationships into account and enables inference of CpG
methylation dynamics. To illustrate our method, we analyzed a high-resolution
methylation map of the differentiation of mouse stem cells into several blood
cell types. Our model can successfully infer unobserved CpG methylation states
from observations at the same sites in related cell types (90% correct), and
this approach more accurately reconstructs missing data than imputation based
on neighboring CpGs (84% correct). Additionally, the single CpG resolution of
our methylation dynamics estimates enabled us to show that DNA sequence context
of CpG sites is informative about methylation dynamics across tissue
differentiation. Finally, we identified genomic regions with clusters of highly
dynamic CpGs and present a likely functional example. Our work establishes a
framework for inference and modeling that is well-suited to DNA methylation
data, and our success suggests that other methods for analyzing DNA nucleotide
substitutions will also translate to the modeling of epigenetic phenomena.

    <title>Human Y-chromosome gene classification using Fractal Dimension &amp; Shannon
  Entropy</title>
    <summary>  All genes on the human Y-chromosome were studied using fractal dimension and
Shannon entropy. Clear outlier clusters were identified. Among these were 6
sequences that have since been withdrawn as CDSs and 1 additional sequence that
is not in the current assembly. A methodology for ranking the sequences based
on deviation from average values of FD and SE was developed. The group of
sequences scored among the 10% largest deviations had abnormally high
likelihood to be from centromeric or pseudoautosomal regions and low likelihood
to be from X-chromosome transposed regions. lncRNA sequences were also enriched
among the outliers. In addition, the number of expressed genes previously
identified for evolutionary study tended to not have large deviations from the
average.

    <title>Identification and characterization of unique to human regulatory
  sequences in embryonic stem cells reveal associations with transposable
  elements, distal enhancers, non-coding RNA, and DNA methylation-driven
  mechanisms of genome editing</title>
    <summary>  Despite significant progress in structural and functional characterization of
human genome, understanding of mechanisms underlying the genetic basis of human
phenotypic uniqueness remains limited. We report that non-randomly distributed
transposable element-derived sequences, most notably HERV-H/LTR7 and L1HS, are
associated with creation of 99.8% unique to human transcription factor binding
sites in genome of embryonic stem cells (ESC). 4,094 unique to human regulatory
loci display selective and site-specific binding of critical regulators (NANOG,
POU5F1, CTCF, Lamin B1) and are preferentially placed within the matrix of
transcriptionally active DNA segments hyper-methylated in ESC. Unique to human
NANOG-binding sites are enriched near the rapidly evolving in primates
protein-coding genes regulating brain size, pluripotency lncRNAs, hESC
enhancers, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-harboring regions immediately adjacent
to binding sites. We propose a proximity placement model explaining how 33-47%
excess of NANOG and POU5F1 proteins immobilized on a DNA scaffold may play a
functional role at distal regulatory elements.

    <title>Taxator-tk: Fast and Precise Taxonomic Assignment of Metagenomes by
  Approximating Evolutionary Neighborhoods</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics characterizes microbial communities by random shotgun sequencing
of DNA isolated directly from an environment of interest. An essential step in
computational metagenome analysis is taxonomic sequence assignment, which
allows us to identify the sequenced community members and to reconstruct
taxonomic bins with sequence data for the individual taxa. We describe an
algorithm and the accompanying software, taxator-tk, which performs taxonomic
sequence assignments by fast approximate determination of evolutionary
neighbors from sequence similarities. Taxator-tk was precise in its taxonomic
assignment across all ranks and taxa for a range of evolutionary distances and
for short sequences. In addition to the taxonomic binning of metagenomes, it is
well suited for profiling microbial communities from metagenome samples
becauseit identifies bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic community members
without being affected by varying primer binding strengths, as in marker gene
amplification, or copy number variations of marker genes across different taxa.
Taxator-tk has an efficient, parallelized implementation that allows the
assignment of 6 Gb of sequence data per day on a standard multiprocessor system
with ten CPU cores and microbial RefSeq as the genomic reference data.

    <title>Exploration and retrieval of whole-metagenome sequencing samples</title>
    <summary>  Over the recent years, the field of whole metagenome shotgun sequencing has
witnessed significant growth due to the high-throughput sequencing technologies
that allow sequencing genomic samples cheaper, faster, and with better coverage
than before. This technical advancement has initiated the trend of sequencing
multiple samples in different conditions or environments to explore the
similarities and dissimilarities of the microbial communities. Examples include
the human microbiome project and various studies of the human intestinal tract.
With the availability of ever larger databases of such measurements, finding
samples similar to a given query sample is becoming a central operation. In
this paper, we develop a content-based exploration and retrieval method for
whole metagenome sequencing samples. We apply a distributed string mining
framework to efficiently extract all informative sequence $k$-mers from a pool
of metagenomic samples and use them to measure the dissimilarity between two
samples. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two human gut
metagenome data sets as well as human microbiome project metagenomic samples.
We observe significant enrichment for diseased gut samples in results of
queries with another diseased sample and very high accuracy in discriminating
between different body sites even though the method is unsupervised. A software
implementation of the DSM framework is available at

    <title>PGA: A Program for Genome Annotation by Comparative Analysis of Maximum
  Likelihood Phylogenies of Genes and Species</title>
    <summary>  The Phylogenetic Genome Annotator (PGA) is a computer program that enables
real-time comparison of 'gene trees' versus 'species trees' obtained from
predicted open reading frames of whole genome data. The gene phylogenies are
inferred for each individual genome predicted proteins whereas the species
phylogenies are inferred from rDNA data. The correlated protein domains,
defined by PFAM, are then displayed side-by-side with a phylogeny of the
corresponding species. The statistical support of gene clusters (branches) is
given by the quartet puzzling method. This analysis readily discriminates
paralogs from orthologs, enabling the identification of proteins originated by
gene duplications and the prediction of possible functional divergence in
groups of similar sequences.

    <title>Toward computational cumulative biology by combining models of
  biological datasets</title>
    <summary>  A main challenge of data-driven sciences is how to make maximal use of the
progressively expanding databases of experimental datasets in order to keep
research cumulative. We introduce the idea of a modeling-based dataset
retrieval engine designed for relating a researcher's experimental dataset to
earlier work in the field. The search is (i) data-driven to enable new
findings, going beyond the state of the art of keyword searches in annotations,
(ii) modeling-driven, to both include biological knowledge and insights learned
from data, and (iii) scalable, as it is accomplished without building one
unified grand model of all data. Assuming each dataset has been modeled
beforehand, by the researchers or by database managers, we apply a rapidly
computable and optimizable combination model to decompose a new dataset into
contributions from earlier relevant models. By using the data-driven
decomposition we identify a network of interrelated datasets from a large
annotated human gene expression atlas. While tissue type and disease were major
driving forces for determining relevant datasets, the found relationships were
richer and the model-based search was more accurate than keyword search; it
moreover recovered biologically meaningful relationships that are not
straightforwardly visible from annotations, for instance, between cells in
different developmental stages such as thymocytes and T-cells. Data-driven
links and citations matched to a large extent; the data-driven links even
uncovered corrections to the publication data, as two of the most linked
datasets were not highly cited and turned out to have wrong publication entries
in the database.

    <title>SAMBLASTER: fast duplicate marking and structural variant read
  extraction</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Illumina DNA sequencing is now the predominant source of raw
genomic data, and data volumes are growing rapidly. Bioinformatic analysis
pipelines are having trouble keeping pace. A common bottleneck in such
pipelines is the requirement to read, write, sort and compress large BAM files
multiple times.
  Results: We present SAMBLASTER, a tool that reduces the number of times such
costly operations are performed. SAMBLASTER is designed to mark duplicates in
read-sorted SAM files as a piped post-pass on DNA aligner output before it is
compressed to BAM. In addition, it can simultaneously output into separate
files the discordant read-pairs and/or split-read mappings used for structural
variant calling. As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is
negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and
runtime. As a stand-alone duplicate marking tool, it performs significantly
better than PICARD or SAMBAMBA in terms of both speed and memory usage, while
achieving nearly identical results.

    <title>Indexing large genome collections on a PC</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: The availability of thousands of invidual genomes of one species
should boost rapid progress in personalized medicine or understanding of the
interaction between genotype and phenotype, to name a few applications. A key
operation useful in such analyses is aligning sequencing reads against a
collection of genomes, which is costly with the use of existing algorithms due
to their large memory requirements.
  Results: We present MuGI, Multiple Genome Index, which reports all
occurrences of a given pattern, in exact and approximate matching model,
against a collection of thousand(s) genomes. Its unique feature is the small
index size fitting in a standard computer with 16--32\,GB, or even 8\,GB, of
RAM, for the 1000GP collection of 1092 diploid human genomes. The solution is
also fast. For example, the exact matching queries are handled in average time
of 39\,$\mu$s and with up to 3 mismatches in 373\,$\mu$s on the test PC with
the index size of 13.4\,GB. For a smaller index, occupying 7.4\,GB in memory,
the respective times grow to 76\,$\mu$s and 917\,$\mu$s.

    <title>High Performance Solutions for Big-data GWAS</title>
    <summary>  In order to associate complex traits with genetic polymorphisms, genome-wide
association studies process huge datasets involving tens of thousands of
individuals genotyped for millions of polymorphisms. When handling these
datasets, which exceed the main memory of contemporary computers, one faces two
distinct challenges: 1) Millions of polymorphisms and thousands of phenotypes
come at the cost of hundreds of gigabytes of data, which can only be kept in
secondary storage; 2) the relatedness of the test population is represented by
a relationship matrix, which, for large populations, can only fit in the
combined main memory of a distributed architecture. In this paper, by using
distributed resources such as Cloud or clusters, we address both challenges:
The genotype and phenotype data is streamed from secondary storage using a
double buffer- ing technique, while the relationship matrix is kept across the
main memory of a distributed memory system. With the help of these solutions,
we develop separate algorithms for studies involving only one or a multitude of
traits. We show that these algorithms sustain high-performance and allow the
analysis of enormous datasets.

    <title>Iterative Learning for Reference-Guided DNA Sequence Assembly from Short
  Reads: Algorithms and Limits of Performance</title>
    <summary>  Recent emergence of next-generation DNA sequencing technology has enabled
acquisition of genetic information at unprecedented scales. In order to
determine the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing platforms typically
employ so-called shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample the target genome
with a library of relatively short overlapping reads. The order of nucleotides
in the reads is determined by processing the acquired noisy signals generated
by the sequencing instrument. Assembly of a genome from potentially erroneous
short reads is a computationally daunting task even in the scenario where a
reference genome exists. Errors and gaps in the reference, and perfect repeat
regions in the target, further render the assembly challenging and cause
inaccuracies. In this paper, we formulate the reference-guided sequence
assembly problem as the inference of the genome sequence on a bipartite graph
and solve it using a message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be
interpreted as the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a
certain prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm
combines the information provided by the reads without needing to know
reliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores). Relation of the
message-passing algorithm to a provably convergent power iteration scheme is
discussed. To evaluate and benchmark the performance of the proposed technique,
we find an analytical expression for the probability of error of a genie-aided
maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision scheme. Results on both simulated and
experimental data demonstrate that the proposed message-passing algorithm
outperforms commonly used state-of-the-art tools, and it nearly achieves the
performance of the aforementioned MAP decision scheme.

    <title>The proteomic to biology inference, a frequently overlooked concern in
  the interpretation of proteomic data: A plea for functional validation</title>
    <summary>  Proteomics will celebrate its 20th year in 2014. In this relatively short
period of time, it has invaded most areas of biology and its use will probably
continue to spread in the future. These two decades have seen a considerable
increase in the speed and sensitivity of protein identification and
characterization, even from complex samples. Indeed, what was a challenge
twenty years ago is now little more than a daily routine. Although not
completely over, the technological challenge now makes room to another
challenge, which is the best possible appraisal and exploitation of proteomic
data to draw the best possible conclusions from a biological point of view. The
point developed in this paper is that proteomic data are almost always
fragmentary. This means in turn that although better than an mRNA level, a
protein level is often insufficient to draw a valid conclusion from a
biological point of view, especially in a world where PTMs play such an
important role. This means in turn that transformation of proteomic data into
biological data requires an important intermediate layer of functional
validation, i.e. not merely the confirmation of protein abundance changes by
other methods, but a functional appraisal of the biological consequences of the
protein level changes highlighted by the proteomic screens.

    <title>Predicting discovery rates of genomic features</title>
    <summary>  Successful sequencing experiments require judicious sample selection.
However, this selection must often be performed on the basis of limited
preliminary data. Predicting the statistical properties of the final sample
based on preliminary data can be challenging, because numerous uncertain model
assumptions may be involved. Here, we ask whether we can predict ``omics"
variation across many samples by sequencing only a fraction of them. In the
infinite-genome limit, we find that a pilot study sequencing $5\%$ of a
population is sufficient to predict the number of genetic variants in the
entire population within $6\%$ of the correct value, using an estimator
agnostic to demography, selection, or population structure. To reach similar
accuracy in a finite genome with millions of polymorphisms, the pilot study
would require about $15\%$ of the population. We present computationally
efficient jackknife and linear programming methods that exhibit substantially
less bias than the state of the art when applied to simulated data and
sub-sampled 1000 Genomes Project data. Extrapolating based on the NHLBI Exome
Sequencing Project data, we predict that $7.2\%$ of sites in the capture region
would be variable in a sample of $50,000$ African-Americans, and $8.8\%$ in a
European sample of equal size. Finally, we show how the linear programming
method can also predict discovery rates of various genomic features, such as
the number of transcription factor binding sites across different cell types.

    <title>Critical Transitions In a Model of a Genetic Regulatory System</title>
    <summary>  We consider a model for substrate-depletion oscillations in genetic systems,
based on a stochastic differential equation with a slowly evolving external
signal. We show the existence of critical transitions in the system. We apply
two methods to numerically test the synthetic time series generated by the
system for early indicators of critical transitions: a detrended fluctuation
analysis method, and a novel method based on topological data analysis
(persistence diagrams).

    <title>A chromatin structure based model accurately predicts DNA replication
  timing in human cells</title>
    <summary>  The metazoan genome is replicated in precise cell lineage specific temporal
order. However, the mechanism controlling this orchestrated process is poorly
understood as no molecular mechanisms have been identified that actively
regulate the firing sequence of genome replication. Here we develop a
mechanistic model of genome replication capable of predicting, with accuracy
rivaling experimental repeats, observed empirical replication timing program in
humans. In our model, replication is initiated in an uncoordinated
(time-stochastic) manner at well-defined sites. The model contains, in addition
to the choice of the genomic landmark that localizes initiation, only a single
adjustable parameter of direct biological relevance: the number of replication
forks. We find that DNase hypersensitive sites are optimal and independent
determinants of DNA replication initiation. We demonstrate that the DNA
replication timing program in human cells is a robust emergent phenomenon that,
by its very nature, does not require a regulatory mechanism determining a
proper replication initiation firing sequence.

    <title>A statistical fat-tail test of predicting regulatory regions in the
  Drosophila genome</title>
    <summary>  A statistical study of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) is presented based on
the estimation of similar-word set distribution. It is observed that CRMs tend
to have a fat-tail distribution. A new statistical fat-tail test with two
kurtosis-based fatness coefficients is proposed to distinguish CRMs from
non-CRMs. As compared with the existing fluffy-tail test, the first fatness
coefficient is designed to reduce computational time, making the novel fat-tail
test very suitable for long sequences and large database analysis in the
post-genome time and the second one to improve separation accuracy between CRMs
and non-CRMs. These two fatness coefficients may be served as valuable
filtering indexes to predict CRMs experimentally.

    <title>Identifying DNA motifs based on match and mismatch alignment information</title>
    <summary>  The conventional way of identifying DNA motifs, solely based on match
alignment information, is susceptible to a high number of spurious sites. A
novel scoring system has been introduced by taking both match and mismatch
alignment information into account. The mismatch alignment information is
useful to remove spurious sites encountered in DNA motif searching. As an
example, a correct TATA box site in Homo sapiens H4/g gene has successfully
been identified based on match and mismatch alignment information.

    <title>An improved scoring matrix for multiple sequence alignment</title>
    <summary>  The way for performing multiple sequence alignment is based on the criterion
of the maximum scored information content computed from a weight matrix, but it
is possible to have two or more alignments to have the same highest score
leading to ambiguities in selecting the best alignment. This paper addresses
this issue by introducing the concept of joint weight matrix to eliminate the
randomness in selecting the best multiple sequence alignment. Alignments with
equal scores are iteratively rescored with the joint weight matrix of
increasing level (nucleotide pairs, triplets and so on) until one single best
alignment is eventually found. This method for resolving ambiguity in multiple
sequence alignment can be easily implemented by use of the improved scoring
matrix.

    <title>Drake's Rule as a Consequence of Approaching Channel Capacity</title>
    <summary>  How mutations accumulate in genomes is the central question of molecular
evolution theories, however our understanding of this process is far from
complete. Drake's rule is a notoriously universal property of genomes from
microbes to mammals - the number of (functional) mutations per-genome
per-generation is approximately constant within a phylum, despite orders of
magnitude differences in genome sizes and diverse populations properties. So
far there is no concise explanation for this phenomenon. A formal model of
storage of genetic information suggests that a genome of any species operates
near its maximum informational storage capacity, and the mutation rate is near
its upper limit, providing a simple explanation for the rule with minimal
assumptions.

    <title>Statistical Mechanics Model for the Dynamics of Collective Epigenetic
  Histone Modification</title>
    <summary>  Epigenetic histone modifications play an important role in the maintenance of
different cell phenotypes. The exact molecular mechanism for inheritance of the
modification patterns over cell generations remains elusive. We construct a
Potts-type model based on experimentally observed nearest-neighbor enzyme
lateral interactions and nucleosome covalent modification state biased enzyme
recruitment. The model can lead to effective nonlocal interactions among
nucleosomes suggested in previous theoretical studies, and epigenetic memory is
robustly inheritable against stochastic cellular processes.

    <title>Near-optimal Assembly for Shotgun Sequencing with Noisy Reads</title>
    <summary>  Recent work identified the fundamental limits on the information requirements
in terms of read length and coverage depth required for successful de novo
genome reconstruction from shotgun sequencing data, based on the idealistic
assumption of no errors in the reads (noiseless reads). In this work, we show
that even when there is noise in the reads, one can successfully reconstruct
with information requirements close to the noiseless fundamental limit. A new
assembly algorithm, X-phased Multibridging, is designed based on a
probabilistic model of the genome. It is shown through analysis to perform well
on the model, and through simulations to perform well on real genomes.

    <title>The effect of linkage on establishment and survival of locally
  beneficial mutations</title>
    <summary>  When organisms adapt to spatially heterogeneous environments, selection may
drive divergence at multiple genes. If populations under divergent selection
also exchange migrants, we expect genetic differentiation to be high at
selected loci, relative to the baseline caused by migration and genetic drift.
Indeed, empirical studies have found peaks of putatively adaptive
differentiation. These are highly variable in length, some of them extending
over several hundreds of thousands of base pairs. How can such 'islands of
divergence' be explained? Physical linkage produces elevated levels of
differentiation at loci close to genes under selection. However, whether this
is enough to account for the observed patterns of divergence is not well
understood. Here, we investigate the fate of a locally beneficial mutation that
arises in linkage to an existing migration-selection polymorphism and derive
two important quantities: the probability that the mutation becomes
established, and the expected time to its extinction. We find that intermediate
levels of recombinations are sometimes favourable, and that physical linkage
can lead to strongly elevated invasion probabilities and extinction times. We
provide a rule of thumb for when this is the case. Moreover, we quantify the
long-term effect of polygenic local adaptation on linked neutral variation.

    <title>Joint analysis of functional genomic data and genome-wide association
  studies of 18 human traits</title>
    <summary>  Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide
association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for
interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We
describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across
the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted
for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple
types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits,
including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels,
height, BMI, and Crohn's disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of
450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers,
and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We
show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein
sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL
cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs
associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I
hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for
example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS
using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with
high-confidence associations by around 5%.

    <title>Approaching allelic probabilities and Genome-Wide Association Studies
  from beta distributions</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we have proposed a model for the distribution of allelic
probabilities for generating populations as reliably as possible. Our objective
was to develop such a model which would allow simulating allelic probabilities
with different observed truncation and de- gree of noise. In addition, we have
also introduced here a complete new approach to analyze a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) dataset, starting from a new test of association with
a statistical distribution and two effect sizes of each genotype. The new
methodologi- cal approach was applied to a real data set together with a Monte
Carlo experiment which showed the power performance of our new method. Finally,
we compared the new method based on beta distribution with the conventional
method (based on Chi-Squared distribu- tion) using the agreement Kappa index
and a principal component analysis (PCA). Both the analyses show found
differences existed between both the approaches while selecting the single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in association.

    <title>Genetic Analysis of Transformed Phenotypes</title>
    <summary>  Linear mixed models (LMMs) are a powerful and established tool for studying
genotype-phenotype relationships. A limiting assumption of LMMs is that the
residuals are Gaussian distributed, a requirement that rarely holds in
practice. Violations of this assumption can lead to false conclusions and
losses in power, and hence it is common practice to pre-process the phenotypic
values to make them Gaussian, for instance by applying logarithmic or other
non-linear transformations. Unfortunately, different phenotypes require
different specific transformations, and choosing a "good" transformation is in
general challenging and subjective. Here, we present an extension of the LMM
that estimates an optimal transformation from the observed data. In extensive
simulations and applications to real data from human, mouse and yeast we show
that using such optimal transformations lead to increased power in genome-wide
association studies and higher accuracy in heritability estimates and phenotype
predictions.

    <title>MICA: A fast short-read aligner that takes full advantage of Intel Many
  Integrated Core Architecture (MIC)</title>
    <summary>  Background: Short-read aligners have recently gained a lot of speed by
exploiting the massive parallelism of GPU. An uprising alternative to GPU is
Intel MIC; supercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with
48,000 MIC boards to offer ~55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows
CPU-based software to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often
inferior to GPU counterparts as an MIC board contains only ~60 cores (while a
GPU board typically has over a thousand cores). Results: To better utilize
MIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we developed a new short-read
aligner MICA that is optimized in view of MICs limitation and the extra
parallelism inside each MIC core. Experiments on aligning 150bp paired-end
reads show that MICA using one MIC board is 4.9 times faster than the BWA-MEM
(using 6-core of a top-end CPU), and slightly faster than SOAP3-dp (using a
GPU). Furthermore, MICAs simplicity allows very efficient scale-up when
multiple MIC boards are used in a node (3 cards give a 14.1-fold speedup over
BWA-MEM). Summary: MICA can be readily used by MIC-enabled supercomputers for
production purpose. We have tested MICA on Tianhe-2 with 90 WGS samples (17.47
Tera-bases), which can be aligned in an hour less than 400 nodes. MICA has
impressive performance even though the current MIC is at its initial stage of
development (the next generation of MIC has been announced to release in late
2014).

    <title>The Cure: Making a game of gene selection for breast cancer survival
  prediction</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Molecular signatures for predicting breast cancer prognosis could
greatly improve care through personalization of treatment. Computational
analyses of genome-wide expression datasets have identified such signatures,
but these signatures leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy,
reproducibility and biological interpretability. Methods that take advantage of
structured prior knowledge (e.g. protein interaction networks) show promise in
helping to define better signatures but most knowledge remains unstructured.
  Crowdsourcing via scientific discovery games is an emerging methodology that
has the potential to tap into human intelligence at scales and in modes
previously unheard of. Here, we developed and evaluated a game called The Cure
on the task of gene selection for breast cancer survival prediction. Our
central hypothesis was that knowledge linking expression patterns of specific
genes to breast cancer outcomes could be captured from game players. We
envisioned capturing knowledge both from the players prior experience and from
their ability to interpret text related to candidate genes presented to them in
the context of the game.
  Results: Between its launch in Sept. 2012 and Sept. 2013, The Cure attracted
more than 1,000 registered players who collectively played nearly 10,000 games.
Gene sets assembled through aggregation of the collected data clearly
demonstrated the accumulation of relevant expert knowledge. In terms of
predictive accuracy, these gene sets provided comparable performance to gene
sets generated using other methods including those used in commercial tests.

    <title>The shrinking human protein coding complement: are there now fewer than
  20,000 genes?</title>
    <summary>  Determining the full complement of protein-coding genes is a key goal of
genome annotation. The most powerful approach for confirming protein coding
potential is the detection of cellular protein expression through peptide mass
spectrometry experiments. Here we map the peptides detected in 7 large-scale
proteomics studies to almost 60% of the protein coding genes in the GENCODE
annotation the human genome. We find that conservation across vertebrate
species and the age of the gene family are key indicators of whether a peptide
will be detected in proteomics experiments. We find peptides for most highly
conserved genes and for practically all genes that evolved before bilateria. At
the same time there is almost no evidence of protein expression for genes that
have appeared since primates, or for genes that do not have any protein-like
features or cross-species conservation. We identify 19 non-protein-like
features such as weak conservation, no protein features or ambiguous
annotations in major databases that are indicators of low peptide detection
rates. We use these features to describe a set of 2,001 genes that are
potentially non-coding, and show that many of these genes behave more like
non-coding genes than protein-coding genes. We detect peptides for just 3% of
these genes. We suggest that many of these 2,001 genes do not code for proteins
under normal circumstances and that they should not be included in the human
protein coding gene catalogue. These potential non-coding genes will be revised
as part of the ongoing human genome annotation effort.

    <title>Sex-biased expression of microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
    <summary>  Most animals have separate sexes. The differential expression of gene
products, in particular that of gene regulators, is underlying sexual
dimorphism. Analyses of sex-biased expression have focused mostly in protein
coding genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that microRNAs, a class of
major gene regulators, are likely to have a significant role in sexual
dimorphism. This role has not been systematically explored so far. Here I study
the sex-biased expression pattern of microRNAs in the model species Drosophila
melanogaster. As with protein coding genes, sex biased microRNAs are associated
with the reproductive function. Strikingly, contrary to protein-coding genes,
male biased microRNAs are enriched in the X chromosome whilst female microRNAs
are mostly autosomal. I propose that the chromosomal distribution is a
consequence of high rates of de novo emergence, and a preference of new
microRNAs to be expressed in the testis. I also suggest that demasculinization
of the X chromosome may not affect microRNAs. Interestingly, female biased
microRNAs are often encoded within protein coding genes that are also expressed
in females. MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target
sex-biased gene transcripts. These results strongly suggest that the sex-biased
expression of microRNAs is mainly a consequence of high rates of microRNA
emergence in the X (male bias) or hitch-hiked expression by host genes (female
bias).

    <title>Reducing pervasive false positive identical-by-descent segments detected
  by large-scale pedigree analysis</title>
    <summary>  Analysis of genomic segments shared identical-by-descent (IBD) between
individuals is fundamental to many genetic applications, from demographic
inference to estimating the heritability of diseases, but IBD detection
accuracy in non-simulated data is largely unknown. In principle, it can be
evaluated using known pedigrees, as IBD segments are by definition inherited
without recombination down a family tree. We extracted 25,432 genotyped
European individuals containing 2,952 father-mother-child trios from the
23andMe, Inc. dataset. We then used GERMLINE, a widely used IBD detection
method, to detect IBD segments within this cohort. Exploiting known familial
relationships, we identified a false positive rate over 67% for 2-4 centiMorgan
(cM) segments, in sharp contrast with accuracies reported in simulated data at
these sizes. Nearly all false positives arose from the allowance of haplotype
switch errors when detecting IBD, a necessity for retrieving long (&gt; 6 cM)
segments in the presence of imperfect phasing. We introduce HaploScore, a
novel, computationally efficient metric that scores IBD segments proportional
to the number of switch errors they contain. Applying HaploScore filtering to
the IBD data at a precision of 0.8 produced a 13-fold increase in recall when
compared to length-based filtering. We replicate the false IBD findings and
demonstrate the generalizability of HaploScore to alternative data sources
using an independent cohort of 555 European individuals from the 1000 Genomes
project. HaploScore can improve the accuracy of segments reported by any IBD
detection method, provided that estimates of the genotyping error rate and
switch error rate are available.

    <title>In silico Proteome Cleavage Reveals Iterative Digestion Strategy for
  High Sequence Coverage</title>
    <summary>  In the post-genome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete
complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method
to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the
proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein
inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun
proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are
identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage
would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all
post translational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy
of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit,
but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that
are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true
origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by
several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide
lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit
observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also
explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be
achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases
and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 91.1% proteome coverage.

    <title>Discovering functional DNA elements using population genomic
  information: A proof of concept using human mtDNA</title>
    <summary>  Identifying the complete set of functional elements within the human genome
would be a windfall for multiple areas of biological research including
medicine, molecular biology, and evolution. Complete knowledge of function
would aid in the prioritization of loci when searching for the genetic bases of
disease or adaptive phenotypes. Because mutations that disrupt function are
disfavored by natural selection, purifying selection leaves a detectable
signature within functional elements; accordingly this signal has been
exploited through the use of genomic comparisons of distantly related species.
However, the functional complement of the genome changes extensively across
time and between lineages, therefore, evidence of the current action of
purifying selection is essential. Because the removal of deleterious mutations
by natural selection also reduces within-species genetic diversity within
functional loci, dense population genetic data have the potential to reveal
genomic elements that are currently functional. Here we assess the potential of
this approach using 16,411 human mitochondrial genomes. We show that the high
density of polymorphism in this dataset precisely delineates regions
experiencing purifying selection. Further, we show that the number of
segregating alleles at a site is strongly correlated with its divergence across
species after accounting for known mutational biases in human mtDNA. These two
measures track one another at a remarkably fine scale across many loci--a
correlation that is purely the result of natural selection. Our results
demonstrate that genetic variation has the potential to reveal exactly which
nucleotides in the genome are currently performing important functions and
likely to have deleterious fitness effects when mutated. As more complete
genomes are sequenced, similar power to reveal purifying selection may be
achievable in the human nuclear genome.

    <title>Baa.pl: A tool to evaluate de novo genome assemblies with RNA
  transcripts</title>
    <summary>  Assessing the correctness of genome assemblies is an important step in any
genome project. Several methods exist, but most are computationally intensive
and, in some cases, inappropriate. Here I present baa.pl, a fast and
easy-to-use program that uses transcript data to evaluate genomic assemblies.
Through simulations using human chromosome 22, I show that baa.pl excels at
detecting levels of missing sequence and contiguity. The program is freely

    <title>Cross-phenotype meta-analysis reveals large-scale trans-eQTLs mediating
  patterns of transcriptional co-regulation</title>
    <summary>  Genetic variation affecting gene regulation is a central driver of phenotypic
differences between individuals and can be used to uncover how biological
processes are organized in a cell. Although detecting cis-eQTLs is now routine,
trans-eQTLs have proven more challenging to find due to the modest variance
explained and the multiple tests burden of testing millions of SNPs for
association to thousands of transcripts. Here, we successfully map trans-eQTLs
with the complementary approach of looking for SNPs associated to the
expression of multiple genes simultaneously. We find 732 trans- eQTLs that
replicate across two continental populations; each trans-eQTL controls large
groups of target transcripts (regulons), which are part of interacting networks
controlled by transcription factors. We are thus able to uncover co-regulated
gene sets and begin describing the cell circuitry of gene regulation.

    <title>RADIA: RNA and DNA Integrated Analysis for Somatic Mutation Detection</title>
    <summary>  The detection of somatic single nucleotide variants is a crucial component to
the characterization of the cancer genome. Mutation calling algorithms thus far
have focused on comparing the normal and tumor genomes from the same
individual. In recent years, it has become routine for projects like The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) to also sequence the tumor RNA. Here we present RADIA (RNA
and DNA Integrated Analysis), a method that combines the patient-matched normal
and tumor DNA with the tumor RNA to detect somatic mutations. The inclusion of
the RNA increases the power to detect somatic mutations, especially at low DNA
allelic frequencies. By integrating the DNA and RNA, we are able to rescue back
calls that would be missed by traditional mutation calling algorithms that only
examine the DNA.
  RADIA was developed for the identification of somatic mutations using both
DNA and RNA from the same individual. We demonstrate high sensitivity (84%) and
very high specificity (98% and 99%) in real data from endometrial carcinoma and
lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA. Mutations with both high DNA and RNA read
support have the highest validation rate of over 99%. We also introduce a
simulation package that spikes in artificial mutations to real data, rather
than simulating sequencing data from a reference genome. We evaluate
sensitivity on the simulation data and demonstrate our ability to rescue back
calls at low DNA allelic frequencies by including the RNA. Finally, we
highlight mutations in important cancer genes that were rescued back due to the
incorporation of the RNA.

    <title>Alignment-free comparison of next-generation sequencing data using
  compression-based distance measures</title>
    <summary>  Enormous volumes of short reads data from next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have posed new challenges to the area of genomic sequence
comparison.
  The multiple sequence alignment approach is hardly applicable to NGS data due
to the challenging problem of short read assembly.
  Thus alignment-free methods need to be developed for the comparison of NGS
samples of short reads.
  Recently, new $k$-mer based distance measures such as {\it CVTree},
$d_{2}^{S}$, {\it co-phylog} have been proposed to address this problem.
  However, those distances depend considerably on the parameter $k$, and how to
choose the optimal $k$ is not trivial since it may depend on different aspects
of the sequence data.
  Hence, in this paper we consider an alternative parameter-free approach:
compression-based distance measures.
  These measures have shown impressive performance on long genome sequences in
previous studies, but they have not been tested on NGS short reads.
  In this study we perform extensive validation and show that the
compression-based distances are highly consistent with those distances obtained
from the $k$-mer based methods, from the alignment-based approach, and from
existing benchmarks in the literature.
  Moreover, as these measures are parameter-free, no optimization is required
and they still perform consistently well on multiple types of sequence data,
for different kinds of species and taxonomy levels.
  The compression-based distance measures are assembly-free, alignment-free,
parameter-free, and thus represent useful tools for the comparison of long
genome sequences and NGS samples of short reads.

    <title>MUSIC: A Hybrid Computing Environment for Burrows-Wheeler Alignment for
  Massive Amount of Short Read Sequence Data</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput DNA sequencers are becoming indispensable in our
understanding of diseases at molecular level, in marker-assisted selection in
agriculture and in microbial genetics research. These sequencing instruments
produce enormous amount of data (often terabytes of raw data in a month) that
requires efficient analysis, management and interpretation. The commonly used
sequencing instrument today produces billions of short reads (upto 150 bases)
from each run. The first step in the data analysis step is alignment of these
short reads to the reference genome of choice. There are different open source
algorithms available for sequence alignment to the reference genome. These
tools normally have a high computational overhead, both in terms of number of
processors and memory. Here, we propose a hybrid-computing environment called
MUSIC (Mapping USIng hybrid Computing) for one of the most popular open source
sequence alignment algorithm, BWA, using accelerators that show significant
improvement in speed over the serial code.

    <title>Causes and Consequences of genetic background effects illuminated by
  integrative genomic analysis</title>
    <summary>  The phenotypic consequences of individual mutations are modulated by the wild
type genetic background in which they occur.Although such background dependence
is widely observed, we do not know whether general patterns across species and
traits exist, nor about the mechanisms underlying it. We also lack knowledge on
how mutations interact with genetic background to influence gene expression,
and how this in turn mediates mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, how genetic
background influences patterns of epistasis remains unclear. To investigate the
genetic basis and genomic consequences of genetic background dependence of the
scallopedE3 allele on the Drosophila melanogaster wing, we generated multiple
novel genome level datasets from a mapping by introgression experiment and a
tagged RNA gene expression dataset. In addition we used whole genome
re-sequencing of the parental lines two commonly used laboratory strains to
predict polymorphic transcription factor binding sites for SD. We integrated
these data with previously published genomic datasets from expression
microarrays and a modifier mutation screen. By searching for genes showing a
congruent signal across multiple datasets, we were able to identify a robust
set of candidate loci contributing to the background dependent effects of
mutations in sd. We also show that the majority of background-dependent
modifiers previously reported are caused by higher-order epistasis, not
quantitative non-complementation. These findings provide a useful foundation
for more detailed investigations of genetic background dependence in this
system, and this approach is likely to prove useful in exploring the genetic
basis of other traits as well.

    <title>motifDiverge: a model for assessing the statistical significance of gene
  regulatory motif divergence between two DNA sequences</title>
    <summary>  Next-generation sequencing technology enables the identification of thousands
of gene regulatory sequences in many cell types and organisms. We consider the
problem of testing if two such sequences differ in their number of binding site
motifs for a given transcription factor (TF) protein. Binding site motifs
impart regulatory function by providing TFs the opportunity to bind to genomic
elements and thereby affect the expression of nearby genes. Evolutionary
changes to such functional DNA are hypothesized to be major contributors to
phenotypic diversity within and between species; but despite the importance of
TF motifs for gene expression, no method exists to test for motif loss or gain.
Assuming that motif counts are Binomially distributed, and allowing for
dependencies between motif instances in evolutionarily related sequences, we
derive the probability mass function of the difference in motif counts between
two nucleotide sequences. We provide a method to numerically estimate this
distribution from genomic data and show through simulations that our estimator
is accurate. Finally, we introduce the R package {\tt motifDiverge} that
implements our methodology and illustrate its application to gene regulatory
enhancers identified by a mouse developmental time course experiment. While
this study was motivated by analysis of regulatory motifs, our results can be
applied to any problem involving two correlated Bernoulli trials.

    <title>An Exploratory Ethnographic Study of Issues and Concerns with Whole
  Genome Sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) will soon allow a large number of
individuals to have their genome fully sequenced. This lays the foundations to
improve modern healthcare, enabling a new era of personalized medicine where
diagnosis and treatment is tailored to the patient's genetic makeup. It also
allows individuals motivated by personal curiosity to have access to their
genetic information, and use it, e.g., to trace their ancestry. However, the
very same progress also amplifies a number of ethical and privacy concerns,
that stem from the unprecedented sensitivity of genomic information and that
are not well studied. This paper presents an exploratory ethnographic study of
users' perception of privacy and ethical issues with WGS, as well as their
attitude toward different WGS programs. We report on a series of
semi-structured interviews, involving 16 participants, and analyze the results
both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis shows that users exhibit
common trust concerns and fear of discrimination, and demand to retain strict
control over their genetic information. Finally, we highlight the need for
further research in the area and follow-up studies that build on our initial
findings.

    <title>System Wide Analyses have Underestimated Protein Abundances and the
  Importance of Transcription in Mammals</title>
    <summary>  Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest that the
protein expressed at the median abundance is present at 8,000 - 16,000
molecules per cell and that differences in mRNA expression between genes
explain only 10-40% of the differences in protein levels. We find, however,
that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and the
relative importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61
housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al.,
we find that the median protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per
cell and that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher
correlation with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. In
addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and protein
abundances, showing that mRNA levels explain at least 56% of the differences in
protein abundance for the genes detected by Schwanhausser et al., though
because one major source of error could not be estimated the true percent
contribution could be higher. We also employed a second, independent strategy
to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to protein expression. We show
that the variance in translation rates directly measured by ribosome profiling
is only 12% of that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. and that the measured and
inferred translation rates correlate only poorly (R2=0.13). Based on this, our
second strategy suggests that mRNA levels explain ~81% of the variance in
protein levels. We also determined the percent contributions of transcription,
RNA degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance in protein
abundances using both of our strategies. While the magnitudes of the two
estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays a more important
role than the earlier studies implied and translation a much smaller role.

    <title>Diverse and widespread contamination evident in the unmapped depths of
  high throughput sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Background: Trace quantities of contaminating DNA are widespread in the
laboratory environment, but their presence has received little attention in the
context of high throughput sequencing. This issue is highlighted by recent
works that have rested controversial claims upon sequencing data that appear to
support the presence of unexpected exogenous species.
  Results: I used reads that preferentially aligned to alternate genomes to
infer the distribution of potential contaminant species in a set of independent
sequencing experiments. I confirmed that dilute samples are more exposed to
contaminating DNA, and, focusing on four single-cell sequencing experiments,
found that these contaminants appear to originate from a wide diversity of
clades. Although negative control libraries prepared from "blank" samples
recovered the highest-frequency contaminants, low-frequency contaminants, which
appeared to make heterogeneous contributions to samples prepared in parallel
within a single experiment, were not well controlled for. I used these results
to show that, despite heavy replication and plausible controls, contamination
can explain all of the observations used to support a recent claim that
complete genes pass from food to human blood.
  Conclusions: Contamination must be considered a potential source of signals
of exogenous species in sequencing data, even if these signals are replicated
in independent experiments, vary across conditions, or indicate a species which
seems a priori unlikely to contaminate. Negative control libraries processed in
parallel are essential to control for contaminant DNAs, but their limited
ability to recover low-frequency contaminants must be recognized.

    <title>GPU-Accelerated BWT Construction for Large Collection of Short Reads</title>
    <summary>  Advances in DNA sequencing technology have stimulated the development of
algorithms and tools for processing very large collections of short strings
(reads). Short-read alignment and assembly are among the most well-studied
problems. Many state-of-the-art aligners, at their core, have used the
Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) as a main-memory index of a reference genome
(typical example, NCBI human genome). Recently, BWT has also found its use in
string-graph assembly, for indexing the reads (i.e., raw data from DNA
sequencers). In a typical data set, the volume of reads is tens of times of the
sequenced genome and can be up to 100 Gigabases. Note that a reference genome
is relatively stable and computing the index is not a frequent task. For reads,
the index has to computed from scratch for each given input. The ability of
efficient BWT construction becomes a much bigger concern than before. In this
paper, we present a practical method called CX1 for constructing the BWT of
very large string collections. CX1 is the first tool that can take advantage of
the parallelism given by a graphics processing unit (GPU, a relative cheap
device providing a thousand or more primitive cores), as well as simultaneously
the parallelism from a multi-core CPU and more interestingly, from a cluster of
GPU-enabled nodes. Using CX1, the BWT of a short-read collection of up to 100
Gigabases can be constructed in less than 2 hours using a machine equipped with
a quad-core CPU and a GPU, or in about 43 minutes using a cluster with 4 such
machines (the speedup is almost linear after excluding the first 16 minutes for
loading the reads from the hard disk). The previously fastest tool BRC is
measured to take 12 hours to process 100 Gigabases on one machine; it is
non-trivial how BRC can be parallelized to take advantage a cluster of
machines, let alone GPUs.

    <title>LUMPY: A probabilistic framework for structural variant discovery</title>
    <summary>  Comprehensive discovery of structural variation (SV) in human genomes from
DNA sequencing requires the integration of multiple alignment signals including
read-pair, split-read and read-depth. However, owing to inherent technical
challenges, most existing SV discovery approaches utilize only one signal and
consequently suffer from reduced sensitivity, especially at low sequence
coverage and for smaller SVs. We present a novel and extremely flexible
probabilistic SV discovery framework that is capable of integrating any number
of SV detection signals including those generated from read alignments or prior
evidence. We demonstrate improved sensitivity over extant methods by combining
paired-end and split-read alignments and emphasize the utility of our framework
for comprehensive studies of structural variation in heterogeneous tumor
genomes. We further discuss the broader utility of this approach for
probabilistic integration of diverse genomic interval datasets.

    <title>The life cycle of Drosophila orphan genes</title>
    <summary>  Orphans are genes restricted to a single phylogenetic lineage and emerge at
high rates. While this predicts an accumulation of genes, the gene number has
remained remarkably constant through evolution. This paradox has not yet been
resolved. Because orphan genes have been mainly analyzed over long evolutionary
time scales, orphan loss has remained unexplored. Here we study the patterns of
orphan turnover among close relatives in the Drosophila obscura group. We show
that orphans are not only emerging at a high rate, but that they are also
rapidly lost. Interestingly, recently emerged orphans are more likely to be
lost than older ones. Furthermore, highly expressed orphans with a strong
male-bias are more likely to be retained. Since both lost and retained orphans
show similar evolutionary signatures of functional conservation, we propose
that orphan loss is not driven by high rates of sequence evolution, but
reflects lineage specific functional requirements.

    <title>Information profiles for DNA pattern discovery</title>
    <summary>  Finite-context modeling is a powerful tool for compressing and hence for
representing DNA sequences. We describe an algorithm to detect genomic
regularities, within a blind discovery strategy. The algorithm uses information
profiles built using suitable combinations of finite-context models. We used
the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972 h- for
illustration, unveilling locations of low information content, which are
usually associated with DNA regions of potential biological interest.

    <title>A conditional compression distance that unveils insights of the genomic
  evolution</title>
    <summary>  We describe a compression-based distance for genomic sequences. Instead of
using the usual conjoint information content, as in the classical Normalized
Compression Distance (NCD), it uses the conditional information content. To
compute this Normalized Conditional Compression Distance (NCCD), we need a
normal conditional compressor, that we built using a mixture of static and
dynamic finite-context models. Using this approach, we measured chromosomal
distances between Hominidae primates and also between Muroidea (rat and mouse),
observing several insights of evolution that so far have not been reported in
the literature.

    <title>Universality splitting in distribution of number of miRNA co-targets</title>
    <summary>  In a recent work [arXiv:1307.1382] it was pointed out that the link-weight
distribution of microRNA (miRNA) co-target network of a wide class of species
are universal up to scaling. The number cell types, widely accepted as a
measure of complexity, turns out to be proportional to these scale-factor. In
this article we discuss additional universal features of these networks and
show that, this universality splits if one considers distribution of number of
common targets of three or more number of miRNAs. These distributions for
different species can be collapsed onto two distinct set of universal
functions, revealing the fact that the species which appeared in early
evolution have different complexity measure compared to those appeared late.

    <title>Whole Exome Sequencing to Estimate Alloreactivity Potential Between
  Donors and Recipients in Stem Cell Transplantation</title>
    <summary>  Whole exome sequencing was performed on HLA-matched stem cell donors and
transplant recipients to measure sequence variation contributing to minor
histocompatibility antigen differences between the two. A large number of
nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in each of the
nine unique donor-recipient pairs tested. This variation was greater in
magnitude in unrelated donors as compared with matched related donors.
Knowledge of the magnitude of exome variation between stem cell transplant
recipients and donors may allow more accurate titration of immunosuppressive
therapy following stem cell transplantation.

    <title>kruX: Matrix-based non-parametric eQTL discovery</title>
    <summary>  The Kruskal-Wallis test is a popular non-parametric statistical test for
identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from genome-wide data
due to its robustness against variations in the underlying genetic model and
expression trait distribution, but testing billions of marker-trait
combinations one-by-one can become computationally prohibitive. We developed
kruX, an algorithm implemented in Matlab, Python and R that uses matrix
multiplications to simultaneously calculate the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic
for several millions of marker-trait combinations at once. KruX is more than
ten thousand times faster than computing associations one-by-one on a typical
human dataset. We used kruX and a dataset of more than 500k SNPs and 20k
expression traits measured in 102 human blood samples to compare eQTLs detected
by the Kruskal-Wallis test to eQTLs detected by the parametric ANOVA and linear
model methods. We found that the Kruskal-Wallis test is more robust against
data outliers and heterogeneous genotype group sizes and detects a higher
proportion of non-linear associations, but is more conservative for calling
additive linear associations. In summary, kruX enables the use of robust
non-parametric methods for massive eQTL mapping without the need for a
high-performance computing infrastructure.

    <title>A model capturing novel strand symmetries in bacterial DNA</title>
    <summary>  Chargaff's second parity rule for short oligonucleotides states that the
frequency of any short nucleotide sequence on a strand is approximately equal
to the frequency of its reverse complement on the same strand. Recent studies
have shown that, with the exception of organellar DNA, this parity rule
generally holds for double stranded DNA genomes and fails to hold for
single-stranded genomes. While Chargaff's first parity rule is fully explained
by the Watson-Crick pairing in the DNA double helix, a definitive explanation
for the second parity rule has not yet been determined. In this work, we
propose a model based on a hidden Markov process for approximating the
distributional structure of primitive DNA sequences. Then, we use the model to
provide another possible theoretical explanation for Chargaff's second parity
rule, and to predict novel distributional aspects of bacterial DNA sequences.

    <title>A possible gut microbiota basis for weight gain side effects of
  antipsychotic drugs</title>
    <summary>  Weight gain is a well-established side effect of both conventional and newer
anti-psychotic drugs, but the cause is not well understood. Recent studies
correlate obesity with the presence or absence of particular genetic sequences
in the gut microbiota. We identified strong associations between protein
targets of antipsychotics and microbiota sequences directly related to weight
regulation in human body, leading to a potential metagenomic mechanism of
action. Further experimental study is recommended.

    <title>Palaeosymbiosis revealed by genomic fossils of Wolbachia in a
  strongyloidean nematode</title>
    <summary>  Wolbachia are common endosymbionts of terrestrial arthropods, and are also
found in nematodes: the animal-parasitic filaria, and the plant-parasite
Radopholus similis. Lateral transfer of Wolbachia DNA to the host genome is
common. We generated a draft genome sequence for the strongyloidean nematode
parasite Dictyocaulus viviparus, the cattle lungworm. In the assembly, we
identified nearly 1 Mb of sequence with similarity to Wolbachia. The fragments
were unlikely to derive from a live Wolbachia infection: most were short, and
the genes were disabled through inactivating mutations. Many fragments were
co-assembled with definitively nematode-derived sequence. We found limited
evidence of expression of the Wolbachia-derived genes. The D. viviparus
Wolbachia genes were most similar to filarial strains, and strains from the
host-promiscuous clade F. We conclude that D. viviparus was infected by
Wolbachia in the past. Genome sequence based surveys are a powerful tool for
revealing the genome archaeology of infection and symbiosis.

    <title>Integrative genomics analysis identifies pericentromeric regions of
  human chromosomes affecting patterns of inter-chromosomal interactions</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide analysis of distributions of densities of long-range interactions
of human chromosomes with each other, nucleoli, nuclear lamina, and binding
sites of chromatin state regulatory proteins, CTCF and STAT1, identifies
non-random highly correlated patterns of density distributions along the
chromosome length for all these features. Marked co-enrichments and clustering
of all these interactions are detected at discrete genomic regions on selected
chromosomes, which are located within pericentromeric heterochromatin and
designated Centromeric Regions of Interphase Chromatin Homing (CENTRICH).
CENTRICH manifest 199-716-fold higher density of inter-chromosomal binding
sites compared to genome-wide or chromosomal averages (p =
2.10E-101-1.08E-292). Sequence alignment analysis shows that CENTRICH represent
unique DNA sequences of 3.9 to 22.4 Kb in size which are: 1) associated with
nucleolus; 2) exhibit highly diverse set of DNA-bound chromatin state
regulators, including marked enrichment of CTCF and STAT1 binding sites; 3)
bind multiple intergenic disease-associated genomic loci (IDAGL) with
documented long-range enhancer activities and established links to increased
risk of developing epithelial malignancies and other common human disorders.
Using distances of SNP loci homing sites within genomic coordinates of CENTRICH
as a proxy of likelihood of disease-linked SNP loci binding to CENTRICH, we
demonstrate statistically significant correlations between the probability of
SNP loci binding to CENTRICH and GWAS-defined odds ratios of increased risk of
a disease for cancer, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. Our
analysis suggests that centromeric sequences and pericentromeric
heterochromatin may play an important role in human cells beyond the critical
functions in chromosome segregation.

    <title>Natural CMT2 variation is associated with genome-wide methylation
  changes and temperature adaptation</title>
    <summary>  A central problem when studying adaptation to a new environment is the
interplay between genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity. Arabidopsis
thaliana has colonized a wide range of habitats across the world and it is
therefore an attractive model for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying
environmental adaptation 4,5. Here, we used publicly available data from two
collections of A. thaliana accessions, covering the native range of the
species, to identify loci associated with differences in climates at the
sampling sites. To address the confounding between geographic location, climate
and population structure, a new genome-wide association analysis method was
developed that facilitates detection of potentially adaptive loci where the
alternative alleles display different tolerable climate ranges. Sixteen novel
such loci, many of which contained candidate genes with amino acid changes,
were found including a strong association between Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) and
variability in seasonal temperatures. The reference allele dominated in areas
with less seasonal variability in temperature, and the alternative allele,
which disrupts genome-wide CHH-methylation, existed in both stable and variable
regions. Our results link natural variation in CMT2, and differential
genome-wide CHH methylation, to the distribution of A. thaliana accessions
across habitats with different seasonal temperature variability. They also
suggest a role for genetic regulation of epigenetic modifications in natural
adaptation, potentially through differential allelic plasticity, and illustrate
the importance of re-analyses of existing data using new analytical methods to
obtain a more complete understanding of the mechanisms contributing to
adaptation.

    <title>Using Ciliate Operations to construct Chromosome Phylogenies</title>
    <summary>  We develop an algorithm based on three basic DNA editing operations suggested
by a model for ciliate micronuclear decryption, to transform a given
permutation into another. The number of ciliate operations performed by our
algorithm during such a transformation is taken to be the distance between two
such permutations. Applying well-known clustering methods to such distance
functions enables one to determine phylogenies among the items to which the
distance functions apply. As an application of these ideas we explore the
relationships among the chromosomes of eight fruitfly (drosophila) species,
using the well-known UPGMA algorithm on the distance function provided by our
algorithm.

    <title>SMaSH: A Benchmarking Toolkit for Human Genome Variant Calling</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Computational methods are essential to extract actionable
information from raw sequencing data, and to thus fulfill the promise of
next-generation sequencing technology. Unfortunately, computational tools
developed to call variants from human sequencing data disagree on many of their
predictions, and current methods to evaluate accuracy and computational
performance are ad-hoc and incomplete. Agreement on benchmarking variant
calling methods would stimulate development of genomic processing tools and
facilitate communication among researchers.
  Results: We propose SMaSH, a benchmarking methodology for evaluating human
genome variant calling algorithms. We generate synthetic datasets, organize and
interpret a wide range of existing benchmarking data for real genomes, and
propose a set of accuracy and computational performance metrics for evaluating
variant calling methods on this benchmarking data. Moreover, we illustrate the
utility of SMaSH to evaluate the performance of some leading single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP), indel, and structural variant calling algorithms.
  Availability: We provide free and open access online to the SMaSH toolkit,
along with detailed documentation, at smash.cs.berkeley.edu.

    <title>Characterizing the infection-induced transcriptome of Nasonia
  vitripennis reveals a preponderance of taxonomically-restricted immune genes</title>
    <summary>  The innate immune system in insects consists of a conserved core signaling
network and rapidly diversifying effector and recognition components, often
containing a high proportion of taxonomically-restricted genes. In the absence
of functional annotation, genes encoding immune system proteins can thus be
difficult to identify, as homology-based approaches generally cannot detect
lineage-specific genes. Here, we use RNA-seq to compare the uninfected and
infection-induced transcriptome in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis to
identify genes regulated by infection. We identify 183 genes significantly
up-regulated by infection and 61 genes significantly down-regulated by
infection. We also produce a new homology-based immune catalog in N.
vitripennis, and show that most infection-induced genes are not assigned an
immune function from homology alone, suggesting the potential for substantial
novel immune components in less-well-studied systems. Finally, we show that a
high proportion of these novel induced genes are taxonomically-restricted,
highlighting the rapid evolution of immune gene content. The combination of
functional annotation using RNA-seq and homology-based annotation provides a
robust method to characterize the innate immune response across a wide variety
of insects, and reveals significant novel features of the Nasonia immune
response.

    <title>Worldwide Patterns of Ancestry, Divergence, and Admixture in
  Domesticated Cattle</title>
    <summary>  The domestication and development of cattle has considerably impacted human
societies, but the histories of cattle breeds have been poorly understood
especially for African, Asian, and American breeds. Using genotypes from 43,043
autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 1,543 animals, we
evaluate the population structure of 134 domesticated bovid breeds. Regardless
of the analytical method or sample subset, the three major groups of Asian
indicine, Eurasian taurine, and African taurine were consistently observed.
Patterns of geographic dispersal resulting from co-migration with humans and
exportation are recognizable in phylogenetic networks. All analytical methods
reveal patterns of hybridization which occurred after divergence. Using 19
breeds, we map the cline of indicine introgression into Africa. We infer that
African taurine possess a large portion of wild African auroch ancestry,
causing their divergence from Eurasian taurine. We detect exportation patterns
in Asia and identify a cline of Eurasian taurine/indicine hybridization in
Asia. We also identify the influence of species other than Bos taurus in the
formation of Asian breeds. We detect the pronounced influence of Shorthorn
cattle in the formation of European breeds. Iberian and Italian cattle possess
introgression from African taurine. American Criollo cattle are shown to be of
Iberian, and not African, decent. Indicine introgression into American cattle
occurred in the Americas, and not Europe. We argue that cattle migration,
movement and trading followed by admixture have been important forces in
shaping modern bovine genomic variation.

    <title>Happy New Year Homo erectus? More evidence for interbreeding with
  archaics predating the modern human/Neanderthal split</title>
    <summary>  A range of a priori hypotheses about the evolution of modern and archaic
genomes are further evaluated and tested. In addition to the well-known
splits/introgressions involving Neanderthal genes into out-of- Africa people,
or Denisovan genes into Oceanians, a further series of archaic splits and
hypotheses proposed in Waddell et al. (2011) are considered in detail. These
include signals of Denisovans with something markedly more archaic and possibly
something more archaic into Papuans as well. These are compared and contrasted
with some well-advertised introgressions such as Denisovan genes across East
Asia, archaic genes into San or non-tree mixing between Oceanians, East Asians
and Europeans. The general result is that these less appreciated and surprising
archaic splits have just as much or more support in genome sequence data.
Further, evaluation confirms the hypothesis that archaic genes are much rarer
on modern X chromosomes, and may even be near totally absent, suggesting strong
selection against their introgression. Modeling of relative split weights
allows an inference of the proportion of the genome the Denisovan seems to have
gotten from an older archaic, and the best estimate is around 2%. Using a mix
of quantitative and qualitative morphological data and novel phylogenetic
methods, robust support is found for multiple distinct middle Pleistocene
lineages. Of these, fossil hominids such as SH5, Petralona, and Dali, in
particular, look like prime candidates for contributing pre-Neanderthal/Modern
archaic genes to Denisovans, while the Jinniu-Shan fossil looks like the best
candidate for a close relative of the Denisovan. That the Papuans might have
received some truly archaic genes appears a good possibility and they might
even be from Homo erectus.

    <title>Phenotypic class ratios as marker signs of different types of
  agamospermy</title>
    <summary>  This article focuses on the development of the method for the genetic
classification of agamospermous reproduction types in plants using sugar beet
as an example. The classification feasibility is ensured by the use of isozymes
as genetic markers allowing the identification of all three phenotypic classes
in the progeny of individual heterozygous diploid plant and is based on
different phenotypic class ratios in the progenies obtained by meiotic and
mitotic agamospermy. The data indicate that for sugar beet meiotic agamospermy
is the more typical since 13 of 15 explored progenies were classified as those
produced by meiotic agamospermy and only 2 as produced by mitotic agamospermy.

    <title>Theoretical Bounds on Mate-Pair Information for Accurate Genome Assembly</title>
    <summary>  Over the past two decades, a series of works have aimed at studying the
problem of genome assembly: the process of reconstructing a genome from
sequence reads. An early formulation of the genome assembly problem showed that
genome reconstruction is NP-hard when framed as finding the shortest sequence
that contains all observed reads. Although this original formulation is very
simplistic and does not allow for mate-pair information, subsequent
formulations have also proven to be NP-hard, and/or may not be guaranteed to
return a correct assembly.
  In this paper, we provide an alternate perspective on the genome assembly
problem by showing genome assembly is easy when provided with sufficient
mate-pair information. Moreover, we quantify the number of mate-pair libraries
necessary and sufficient for accurate genome assembly, in terms of the length
of the longest repetitive region within a genome. In our analysis, we consider
an idealized sequencing model where each mate-pair library generates pairs of
error free reads with a fixed and known insert size at each position in the
genome.
  Even in this idealized model, we show that accurate genome reconstruction
cannot be guaranteed in the worst case unless at least roughly R/2L mate-pair
libraries are produced, where R is the length of the longest repetitive region
in the genome and L is the length of each read. On the other hand, if (R/L)+1
mate-pair libraries are provided, then a simple algorithm can be used to find a
correct genome assembly easily in polynomial time. Although (R/L)+1 mate-pair
libraries can be too much to produce in practice, the previous bounds only hold
in the worst case. In our last result, we show that if additional conditions
hold on a genome, a correct assembly can be guaranteed with only O(log (R/L))
mate-pair libraries.

    <title>Sequence Capture Versus Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing for
  Phylogeography</title>
    <summary>  Genomic datasets generated with massively parallel sequencing methods have
the potential to propel systematics in new and exciting directions, but
selecting appropriate markers and methods is not straightforward. We applied
two approaches with particular promise for systematics, restriction site
associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) and sequence capture (Seq-cap) of
ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to the same set of samples from a non-model,
Neotropical bird. We found that both RAD-Seq and Seq-cap produced genomic
datasets containing thousands of loci and SNPs and that the inferred population
assignments and species trees were concordant between datasets. However,
model-based estimates of demographic parameters differed between datasets,
particularly when we estimated the parameters using a method based on allele
frequency spectra. The differences we observed may result from differences in
assembly, alignment, and filtering of sequence data between methods, and our
findings suggest that caution is warranted when using allele frequencies to
estimate parameters from low-coverage sequencing data. We further explored the
differences between methods using simulated Seq-cap- and RAD-Seq-like datasets.
Analyses of simulated data suggest that increasing the number of loci from 500
to 5000 increased phylogenetic concordance factors and the accuracy and
precision of demographic parameter estimates, but increasing the number of loci
past 5000 resulted in minimal gains. Increasing locus length from 64 bp to 500
bp improved phylogenetic concordance factors and minimal gains were observed
with loci longer than 500 bp, but locus length did not influence the accuracy
and precision of demographic parameter estimates. We discuss our results
relative to the diversity of data collection methods available, and we provide
advice for harnessing next-generation sequencing for systematics research.

    <title>Accurate and robust genomic prediction of celiac disease using
  statistical learning</title>
    <summary>  Practical application of genomic-based risk stratification to clinical
diagnosis is appealing yet performance varies widely depending on the disease
and genomic risk score (GRS) method. Celiac disease (CD), a common
immune-mediated illness, is strongly genetically determined and requires
specific HLA haplotypes. HLA testing can exclude diagnosis but has low
specificity, providing little information suitable for clinical risk
stratification. Using six European CD cohorts, we provide a proof-of-concept
that statistical learning approaches which simultaneously model all SNPs can
generate robust and highly accurate predictive models based on genome-wide SNP
profiles. The high predictive capacity replicated both in cross-validation
within each cohort (AUC of 0.87-0.89) and in independent replication across
cohorts (AUC of 0.86-0.9), despite differences in ethnicity. The models
explained 30-35% of disease variance and up to $\sim43\%$ of heritability. The
GRS's utility was assessed in different clinically relevant settings.
Comparable to HLA typing, the GRS can be used to identify individuals without
CD with $\geq99.6\%$ negative predictive value however, unlike HLA typing,
patients can also be stratified into categories of higher-risk for CD who would
benefit from more invasive and costly definitive testing. The GRS is flexible
and its performance can be adapted to the clinical situation by adjusting the
threshold cut-off. Despite explaining a minority of disease heritability, our
findings indicate a predictive GRS provides clinically relevant information to
improve upon current diagnostic pathways for CD, and support further studies
evaluating the clinical utility of this approach in CD and other complex
diseases.

    <title>RNA-based regulation: dynamics and response to perturbations of
  competing RNAs</title>
    <summary>  The observation that, through a titration mechanism, microRNAs (miRNAs) can
act as mediators of effective interactions among their common targets
(competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs) has brought forward the idea ('ceRNA
hypothesis') that RNAs can regulate each other in extended 'cross-talk'
networks. Such an ability might play a major role in post-transcriptional
regulation (PTR) in shaping a cell's protein repertoire. Recent work focusing
on the emergent properties of the cross-talk networks has emphasized the high
flexibility and selectivity that may be achieved at stationarity. On the other
hand, dynamical aspects, possibly crucial on the relevant time scales, are far
less clear. We have carried out a dynamical study of the ceRNA hypothesis on a
model of PTR. Sensitivity analysis shows that ceRNA cross-talk is dynamically
extended, i.e. it may take place on time scales shorter than those required to
achieve stationairity even in cases where no cross-talk occurs in the steady
state, and is possibly amplified. Besides, in case of large, transfection-like
perturbations the system may develop strongly non-linear, threshold response.
Finally, we show that the ceRNA effect provides a very efficient way for a cell
to achieve fast positive shifts in the level of a ceRNA when necessary. These
results indicate that competition for miRNAs may indeed provide an elementary
mechanism to achieve system-level regulatory effects on the transcriptome over
physiologically relevant time scales.

    <title>An Intuitive Graphical Webserver for Multiple-Choice Protein Sequence
  Search</title>
    <summary>  Every day tens of thousands of sequence searches and sequence alignment
queries are submitted to webservers. The capitalized word "BLAST" become a
verb, describing the act of performing sequence search and alignment. However,
if one needs to search for sequences that contain, for example, two hydrophobic
and three polar residues at five given positions, the query formation on the
most frequently used webservers will be difficult. Some servers support the
formation of queries with regular expressions, but most of the users are
unfamiliar with their syntax. Here we present an intuitive, easily applicable
webserver, the Protein Sequence Analysis server, that allows the formation of
multiple choice queries by simply drawing the residues to their positions; if
more than one residue are drawn to the same position, then they will be nicely
stacked on the user interface, indicating the multiple choice at he given
position. This computer-game like interface is natural and intuitive, and the
coloring of the residues makes possible to form queries requiring not just
certain amino acids in the given positions, but also small nonpolar, negatively
charged, hydrophobic, positively charged, or polar ones. The webserver is
available at http://psa.pitgroup.org.

    <title>Integrating sequencing datasets to form highly confident SNP and indel
  genotype calls for a whole human genome</title>
    <summary>  Clinical adoption of human genome sequencing requires methods with known
accuracy of genotype calls at millions or billions of positions across a
genome. Previous work showing discordance amongst sequencing methods and
algorithms has made clear the need for a highly accurate set of genotypes
across a whole genome that could be used as a benchmark. We present methods to
make highly confident SNP, indel, and homozygous reference genotype calls for
NA12878, the pilot genome for the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. We minimize
bias towards any method by integrating and arbitrating between 14 datasets from
5 sequencing technologies, 7 mappers, and 3 variant callers. Regions for which
no confident genotype call could be made are identified as uncertain, and
classified into different reasons for uncertainty. Our highly confident
genotype calls are publicly available on the Genome Comparison and Analytic
Testing (GCAT) website to enable real-time benchmarking of any method.

    <title>CONCOCT: Clustering cONtigs on COverage and ComposiTion</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics enables the reconstruction of microbial genomes in complex
microbial communities without the need for culturing. Since assembly typically
results in fragmented genomes the grouping of genome fragments (contigs)
belonging to the same genome, a process referred to as binning, remains a major
informatics challenge. Here we present CONCOCT, a computer program that
combines three types of information - sequence composition, coverage across
multiple sample, and read-pair linkage - to automatically bin contigs into
genomes. We demonstrate high recall and precision rates of the program on
artificial as well as real human gut metagenome datasets.

    <title>FPCB : a simple and swift strategy for mirror repeat identification</title>
    <summary>  After the recent advancement of sequencing strategies, mirror repeats have
been found to be present in the gene sequence of many organisms and species.
This presence of mirror repeats in most of the sequences indicates towards some
important functional role of these repeats. However, a simple and quick
strategy to search these repeats in a given sequence is not available. We in
this manuscript have proposed a simple and swift strategy named as FPCB
strategy to identify mirror repeats in a give sequence. The strategy includes
three simple steps of downloading sequencing in FASTA format (F), making its
parallel complement (PC) and finally performing a homology search with the
original sequence (B). At least twenty genes were analyzed using the proposed
study. A number and types of mirror repeats were observed. We have also tried
to give nomenclature to these repeats. We hope that the proposed FPCB strategy
will be quite helpful for the identification of mirror repeats in DNA or mRNA
sequence. Also the strategy may help in unraveling the functional role of
mirror repeats in various processes including evolution.

    <title>DuctApe: a suite for the analysis and correlation of genomic and
  OmnilogTM Phenotype Microarray data</title>
    <summary>  Addressing the functionality of genomes is one of the most important and
challenging tasks of today's biology. In particular the ability to link
genotypes to corresponding phenotypes is of interest in the reconstruction and
biotechnological manipulation of metabolic pathways. Over the last years, the
OmniLogTM Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology has been used to address many
specific issues related to the metabolic functionality of microorganisms.
However, computational tools that could directly link PM data with the gene(s)
of interest followed by the extraction of information on genephenotype
correlation are still missing. Here we present DuctApe, a suite that allows the
analysis of both genomic sequences and PM data, to find metabolic differences
among PM experiments and to correlate them with KEGG pathways and gene
presence/absence patterns. As example, an application of the program to four
bacterial datasets is presented. The source code and tutorials are available at
http://combogenomics.github.io/DuctApe/.

    <title>Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data is Inadmissible</title>
    <summary>  The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of
DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the
per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same
sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson
model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that
simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological
variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for
RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq.
  We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show
that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative
binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting
differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson
mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude
proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false
positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the
rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately
clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size
threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in
practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling
microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in
edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to
normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and
well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid
rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these
tools in the R package, phyloseq.

    <title>Expanding the Grammar of Biology</title>
    <summary>  We metaphorically call "Grammar of Biology" a small field of genomic
research, whose main objective is to search for intrinsic DNA sequence
properties. Erwin Chargaff inaugurated it back in 50s, but since then little
progress has been made. It remained almost neglected until early 90s, when
Vinayakumar V. Prabhu made a major contribution determining the Symmetry
Principle. Remarkably, different sciences have contributed for its development,
for instance, Chargaff used his Chemistry background to discover the so-called
Chargaff's rules; taking advantage of several publicly available genomic
sequences, and through Computational and Statistical analyses, Prabhu
identified the Symmetry Principle and, recently, using a Mathematical approach,
we have discovered four new Generalized Chargaff's rules. Our work has expanded
the "Grammar of Biology", and created the conceptual and theoretical framework
necessary to further developments.

    <title>The Foundations of Genodynamics: The Development of Metrics for
  Genomic-Environmental Interactions</title>
    <summary>  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent an important type of dynamic
sites within the human genome. These common variants often locally correlate
into more complex multi-SNP haploblocks that are maintained throughout
generations in a stable population. The information encoded in the structure of
common SNPs and SNP haploblock variation can be characterized through a
normalized information content (NIC) metric. Such an intrinsic measure allows
disparate regions of individual genomes and the genomes of various populations
to be quantitatively compared in a meaningful way.
  Using our defined measures of genomic information, the interplay of
maintained statistical variations due to the environmental baths within which
stable populations exist can be interrogated. We develop the analogous
"thermodynamics" characterizing the state variables for genomic populations
that are stable under stochastic environmental stresses. Since living systems
have not been found to develop in the absence of environmental influences, we
focus on describing the analogous genomic free energy measures in this
development.
  The intensive parameter describing how an environment drives genomic
diversity is found to depend inversely upon the NIC of the genome of a stable
population within that environment. Once this environmental potential has been
determined from the whole genome of a population, additive state variables can
be directly related to the probabilities of the occurrence of given viable SNP
based units (alleles) within that genome. This formulation allows the
determination of both population averaged state variables as well as the
genomic energies of individual alleles and their combinations. The
determination of individual allelic potentials then should allow the
parameterization of specific environmental influences upon shared alleles
across populations in varying environments.

    <title>BayMeth: Improved DNA methylation quantification for affinity capture
  sequencing data using a flexible Bayesian approach</title>
    <summary>  DNA methylation (DNAme) is a critical component of the epigenetic regulatory
machinery and aberrations in DNAme patterns occur in many diseases, such as
cancer. Mapping and understanding DNAme profiles offers considerable promise
for reversing the aberrant states. There are several approaches to analyze
DNAme, which vary widely in cost, resolution and coverage. Affinity capture and
high-throughput sequencing of methylated DNA strike a good balance between the
high cost of whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) and the low coverage of
methylation arrays. However, existing methods cannot adequately differentiate
between hypomethylation patterns and low capture efficiency, and do not offer
flexibility to integrate copy number variation (CNV). Furthermore, no
uncertainty estimates are provided, which may prove useful for combining data
from multiple protocols or propagating into downstream analysis. We propose an
empirical Bayes framework that uses a fully methylated (i.e. SssI treated)
control sample to transform observed read densities into regional methylation
estimates. In our model, inefficient capture can be distinguished from low
methylation levels by means of larger posterior variances. Furthermore, we can
integrate CNV by introducing a multiplicative offset into our Poisson model
framework. Notably, our model offers analytic expressions for the mean and
variance of the methylation level and thus is fast to compute. Our algorithm
outperforms existing approaches in terms of bias, mean-squared error and
coverage probabilities as illustrated on multiple reference datasets. Although
our method provides advantages even without the SssI-control, considerable
improvement is achieved by its incorporation. Our method can be applied to
methylated DNA affinity enrichment assays (e.g MBD-seq, MeDIP-seq) and a
software implementation is available in the Bioconductor Repitools package.

    <title>Ribosome profiling reveals post-transcriptional buffering of divergent
  gene expression in yeast</title>
    <summary>  Understanding the patterns and causes of phenotypic divergence is a central
goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly
variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of
post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we
used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation
efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S.
paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies
differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript
leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation.
Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers
species-differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more
conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling
in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and
trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and
translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for
these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent
mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes
with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or
under-expressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant
ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in
translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression.
Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may
increase the robustness of gene regulation.

    <title>How to use 2D gel electrophoresis in plant proteomics</title>
    <summary>  Two-dimensional electrophoresis has nurtured the birth of proteomics. It is
however no longer the exclusive setup used in proteomics, with the development
of shotgun proteomics techniques that appear more fancy and fashionable
nowadays.Nevertheless, 2D gel-based proteomics still has valuable features, and
sometimes unique ones, which make it often an attractive choice when a
proteomics strategy must be selected. These features are detailed in this
chapter, as is the rationale for selecting or not 2D gel-based proteomics as a
proteomic strategy.

    <title>A Quantitative Understanding of Human Sex Chromosomal Genes</title>
    <summary>  In the last few decades, the human allosomes are engrossed in an intensive
attention among researchers. The allosomes are now already been sequenced and
found there are about 2000 and 78 genes in human X and Y chromosomes
respectively. The hemizygosity of the human X chromosome in males exposes
recessive disease alleles, and this phenomenon has prompted decades of
intensive study of X-linked disorders. By contrast, the small size of the human
Y chromosome, and its prominent long-arm heterochromatic region suggested
absence of function beyond sex determination. But the present problem is to
accomplish whether a given sequence of nucleotides i.e. a DNA is a Human X or Y
chromosomal genes or not, without any biological experimental support. In our
perspective, a proper quantitative understanding of these genes is required to
justify or nullify whether a given sequence is a Human X or Y chromosomal gene.
In this paper, some of the X and Y chromosomal genes have been quantified in
genomic and proteomic level through Fractal Geometric and Mathematical
Morphometric analysis. Using the proposed quantitative model, one can easily
make probable justification or deterministic nullification whether a given
sequence of nucleotides is a probable Human X or Y chromosomal gene or not,
without seeking any biological experiment. Of course, a further biological
experiment is essential to validate it as the probable Human X or Y chromosomal
gene homologue. This study would enable Biologists to understand these genes in
more quantitative manner instead of their qualitative features.

    <title>Statistical model of intra-chromosome contact maps</title>
    <summary>  The statistical properties of intra-chromosome maps obtained by a genome-wide
chromosome conformation capture method (Hi-C) are described in the framework of
the hierarchical crumpling model of heteropolymer chain with quenched disorder
in the primary sequence. We conjecture that the observed Hi-C maps are
statistical averages over many different ways of hierarchical genome folding,
and show that the existence of quenched primary structure coupled with
hierarchical folding can induce the observed fine structure of intra-chromosome
contact maps.

    <title>H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase MLL4 is required for enhancer
  activation during cell differentiation</title>
    <summary>  Enhancers play a central role in cell-type-specific gene expression and are
marked by H3K4me1/2. Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27ac. However,
the methyltransferases responsible for H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive.
Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate
cell-type-specific gene expression is unclear. Here we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as
a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional
redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model
systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and
differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized
on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors
(TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of MLL4 markedly
decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Polymerase II and Mediator levels on enhancers
and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell
differentiation. Together, these findings identify MLL4 as a major mammalian
H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during
cell differentiation.

    <title>Evolution at two levels of gene expression in yeast</title>
    <summary>  Despite the greater functional importance of protein levels, our knowledge of
gene expression evolution is based almost entirely on studies of mRNA levels.
In contrast, our understanding of how translational regulation evolves has
lagged far behind. Here we have applied ribosome profiling - which measures
both global mRNA levels and their translation rates - to two species of
Saccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the
relative contributions of changes in mRNA abundance and translation to
regulatory evolution. We report that both cis and trans-acting regulatory
divergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35% of genes. The
majority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in mRNA abundance,
suggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory
levels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting
on a number of yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing
selection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover
multiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between
species. Our analysis reveals the under-appreciated complexity of
post-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the
search for the locus of selection into the binary categories of 'coding' vs.
'regulatory' may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple
regulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.

    <title>Agriculture driving male expansion in Neolithic Time</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of agriculture is suggested to have driven extensive human
population growths. However, genetic evidence from maternal mitochondrial
genomes suggests major population expansions began before the emergence of
agriculture. Therefore, role of agriculture that played in initial population
expansions still remains controversial. Here, we analyzed a set of globally
distributed whole Y chromosome and mitochondrial genomes of 526 male samples
from 1000 Genome Project. We found that most major paternal lineage expansions
coalesced in Neolithic Time. The estimated effective population sizes through
time revealed strong evidence for 10- to 100-fold increase in population growth
of males with the advent of agriculture. This sex-biased Neolithic expansion
might result from the reduction in hunting-related mortality of males.

    <title>Transposable element sequence evolution is influenced by gene context</title>
    <summary>  Background: Transposable elements (TEs) in eukaryote genomes are
quantitatively the main components affecting genome size, structure and
expression. The dynamics of their insertion and deletion depend on diverse
factors varying in strength and nature along the genome. We address here how TE
sequence evolution is affected by neighboring genes and the chromatin status
(euchromatin or heterochromatin) at their insertion site. Results: We estimated
ages of TE sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana, and found that they depend on the
distance to the nearest genes: TEs located close to genes are older than those
that are more distant. Consequently, TE sequences in heterochromatic regions,
which are gene-poor regions, are surprisingly younger and longer than that
elsewhere. Conclusions: We provide evidence for biased TE age distribution
close or near to genes. Interestingly, TE sequences in euchromatin and those in
heterochromatin evolve at different rates, and as a result, could explain that
TE sequences in heterochromatin tend to be younger and longer. Then, we revisit
models of TE sequence dynamics and point out differences for TE-rich genomes,
such as maize and wheat, compared to TE-poor genomes such as fly and A.
thaliana.

    <title>Unstable Angina is a syndrome correlated to mixed Th17 and Th1 immune
  disorder</title>
    <summary>  Unstable angina is common clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis. However,
the detailed pathogenesis of unstable angina is still not known. Here, I
propose that unstable angina is a mixed TH17 and TH1 immune disorder. By using
microarray analysis, I find out that TH1 and TH17 related cytokine, cytokine
receptor, chemokines, complement, immune-related transcription factors,
anti-bacterial genes, Toll-like receptors, and heat shock proteins are all
up-regulated in peripheral leukocytes of unstable angina. In addition,
H-ATPase, glycolytic genes, platelet and RBC related genes are also
up-regulated in peripheral leukocytes of during unstable angina. It also
implies that atherosclerosis is a mixed TH17 and TH1 autoimmune disease. If we
know the etiology of unstable angina as well as atherosclerosis better, we can
have better methods to control and prevent this detrimental illness.

    <title>Genomic and phenotypic characterisation of a wild Medaka population:
  Establishing an isogenic population genetic resource in fish</title>
    <summary>  Background Oryzias latipes (Medaka) has been established as a vertebrate
genetic model for over a century, and has recently been rediscovered outside
its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to
reinvigorate Medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic
panel derived from a single wild population. Results Here we characterise the
genomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese
population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic
panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental
population structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties
suitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric
traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will
be feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of
these Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of
geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little
significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population
since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that
the Southern Japanese Medaka existed as a larger older population which went
through a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we
detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population.
Conclusions These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu Medaka
samples are suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel
and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.

    <title>Sepsis is a syndrome with hyperactivity of TH17-like innate immunity and
  hypoactivity of adaptive immunity</title>
    <summary>  Currently, there are two major theories for the pathogenesis of sepsis:
hyperimmune and hypoimmune. Hyperimmune theory suggests that cytokine storm
causes the symptoms of sepsis. On the contrary, hypoimmune theory suggests that
immunosuppression causes the manifestations of sepsis. By using microarray
study, this study implies that hyperactivity of TH17-like innate immunity and
failure of adaptive immunity are noted in sepsis patients. I find out that
innate immunity related genes are significantly up-regulated including CD14,
TLR1,2,4,5,8, HSP70, CEBP proteins, AP1(JUNB, FOSL2), TGF-{\beta}, IL-6,
TGF-{\alpha}, CSF2 receptor, TNFRSF1A, S100A binding proteins, CCR2, formyl
peptide receptor2, amyloid proteins, pentraxin, defensins, CLEC5A, whole
complement machinery, CPD, NCF, MMP, neutrophil elastase, caspases, IgG and IgA
Fc receptors(CD64, CD32), ALOX5, PTGS, LTB4R, LTA4H, and ICAM1. Majority of
adaptive immunity genes are down-regulated including MHC related genes, TCR
genes, granzymes/perforin, CD40, CD8, CD3, TCR signaling, BCR signaling, T &amp; B
cell specific transcription factors, NK killer receptors, and TH17 helper
specific transcription factors(STAT3, RORA, REL). In addition, Treg related
genes are up-regulated including TGF{\beta}, IL-15, STAT5B, SMAD2/4, CD36, and
thrombospondin. Thus, both hyperimmune and hypoimmune play important roles in
the pathophysiology of sepsis.

    <title>Markovianness and Conditional Independence in Annotated Bacterial DNA</title>
    <summary>  We explore the probabilistic structure of DNA in a number of bacterial
genomes and conclude that a form of Markovianness is present at the boundaries
between coding and non-coding regions, that is, the sequence of START and STOP
codons annotated for the bacterial genome. This sequence is shown to satisfy a
conditional independence property which allows its governing Markov chain to be
uniquely identified from the abundances of START and STOP codons. Furthermore,
the annotated sequence is shown to comply with Chargaff's second parity rule at
the codon level.

    <title>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a TH17-like and Treg immune
  disease</title>
    <summary>  Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a very severe syndrome leading
to respiratory failure and subsequent mortality. Sepsis is one of the leading
causes of ARDS. Thus, extracellular bacteria play an important role in the
pathophysiology of ARDS. Overactivated neutrophils are the major effector cells
in ARDS. Thus, extracellular bacteria triggered TH17-like innate immunity with
neutrophil activation might accounts for the etiology of ARDS. Here, microarray
analysis was employed to describe TH17-like innate immunity-related cytokine
including TGF-{\beta} and IL-6 up-regulation in whole blood of ARDS patients.
It was found that the innate TH17-related TLR1,2,4,5,8, HSP70, G-CSF, GM-CSF,
complements, defensin, PMN chemokines, cathepsins, Fc receptors, NCFs, FOS,
JunB, CEBPs, NFkB, and leukotriene B4 are all up-regulated. TGF-{\beta}
secreting Treg cells play important roles in lung fibrosis. Up-regulation of
Treg associated STAT5B and TGF-{\beta} with down-regulation of MHC genes, TCR
genes, and co-stimulation molecule CD86 are noted. Key TH17 transcription
factors, STAT3 and ROR{\alpha}, are down-regulated. Thus, the full adaptive
TH17 helper CD4 T cells may not be successfully triggered. Many fibrosis
promoting genes are also up-regulated including MMP8, MMP9, FGF13, TIMP1,
TIMP2, PLOD1, P4HB, P4HA1, PDGFC, HMMR, HS2ST1, CHSY1, and CSGALNACT. Failure
to induce successful adaptive immunity could also attribute to ARDS
pathogenesis. Thus, ARDS is actually a TH17-like and Treg immune disorder.

    <title>GeneZip: A software package for storage-efficient processing of genotype
  data</title>
    <summary>  Genome wide association studies directly assay 10^6 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) across a study cohort. Probabilistic estimation of
additional sites by genotype imputation can increase this set of variants by
10- to 40-fold. Even with modest sample sizes (10^3-10^4), these resulting
imputed datasets, containing 10^10-10^11 double-precision values, are
incompatible with simultaneous lossless storage in RAM using standard methods.
Existing solutions for this problem require compromises in either genotype
accuracy or complexity of permissible statistical methods. Here, we present a
C/C++ library that dynamically compresses probabilistic genotype data as they
are loaded into memory. This method uses a customization of the DEFLATE (gzip)
algorithm, and maintains constant-time access to any SNP. Average compression
ratios of more than 9-fold are observed in test data.

    <title>Reconstructing Native American Migrations from Whole-genome and
  Whole-exome Data</title>
    <summary>  There is great scientific and popular interest in understanding the genetic
history of populations in the Americas. We wish to understand when different
regions of the continent were inhabited, where settlers came from, and how
current inhabitants relate genetically to earlier populations. Recent studies
unraveled parts of the genetic history of the continent using genotyping arrays
and uniparental markers. The 1000 Genomes Project provides a unique opportunity
for improving our understanding of population genetic history by providing over
a hundred sequenced low coverage genomes and exomes from Colombian (CLM),
Mexican-American (MXL), and Puerto Rican (PUR) populations. Here, we explore
the genomic contributions of African, European, and Native American ancestry to
these populations. Estimated Native American ancestry is 48% in MXL, 25% in
CLM, and 13% in PUR. Native American ancestry in PUR is most closely related to
populations surrounding the Orinoco River basin, confirming the Southern
America ancestry of the Ta\'ino people of the Caribbean. We present new methods
to estimate the allele frequencies in the Native American fraction of the
populations, and model their distribution using a demographic model for three
ancestral Native American populations. These ancestral populations likely split
in close succession: the most likely scenario, based on a peopling of the
Americas 16 thousand years ago (kya), supports that the MXL Ancestors split
12.2kya, with a subsequent split of the ancestors to CLM and PUR 11.7kya. The
model also features effective populations of 62,000 in Mexico, 8,700 in
Colombia, and 1,900 in Puerto Rico. Modeling Identity-by-descent and ancestry
tract length, we show that post-contact populations differ markedly in their
effective sizes and migration patterns, with Puerto Rico showing the smallest
effective size and the earlier migration from Europe.

    <title>MetaPar: Metagenomic Sequence Assembly via Iterative Reclassification</title>
    <summary>  We introduce a parallel algorithmic architecture for metagenomic sequence
assembly, termed MetaPar, which allows for significant reductions in assembly
time and consequently enables the processing of large genomic datasets on
computers with low memory usage. The gist of the approach is to iteratively
perform read (re)classification based on phylogenetic marker genes and
assembler outputs generated from random subsets of metagenomic reads. Once a
sufficiently accurate classification within genera is performed, de novo
metagenomic assemblers (such as Velvet or IDBA-UD) or reference based
assemblers may be used for contig construction. We analyze the performance of
MetaPar on synthetic data consisting of 15 randomly chosen species from the
NCBI database through the effective gap and effective coverage metrics.

    <title>Reducing assembly complexity of microbial genomes with single-molecule
  sequencing</title>
    <summary>  Background: The short reads output by first- and second-generation DNA
sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes.
Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant
resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies.
Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly
increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem.
  Results: To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial
genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and
analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our
results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can
be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS
sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than
typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads.
  Conclusions: Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data
reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $1,000 for most genomes, and future
advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is
expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of
microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies
of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.

    <title>Multidimensional separation prior to mass spectrometry: Getting closer
  to the bottom of the iceberg</title>
    <summary>  While prefractionation has previously been shown to improve results in MS
analysis, a novel combination provides an additional dimension of separation:
protein fractionation by SDS-PAGE followed by IEF of tryptic peptides before
separation by RP-LC [Atanassov and Urlaub, Proteomics 2013, 13, 2947-2955].
This three-step separation procedure prior to MS/MS substantially increases
proteome coverage and represents a further step toward a more comprehensive
analysis of complex proteomes.

    <title>When 2D is not enough, go for an extra dimension</title>
    <summary>  The use of an extra SDS separation in a different buffer system provide a
technique for deconvoluting 2D gel spots made of several proteins (Colignon et
al. Proteomics, 2013, 13, 2077-2082). This technique keeps the quantitative
analysis of the protein amounts and combines it with a strongly improved
identification process by mass spectrometry, removing identification
ambiguities in most cases. In some favorable cases, posttranslational variants
can be separated by this procedure. This versatile and easy to use technique is
anticipated to be a very valuable addition to the toolbox used in 2D gel-based
proteomics.

    <title>MCUIUC -- A New Framework for Metagenomic Read Compression</title>
    <summary>  Metagenomics is an emerging field of molecular biology concerned with
analyzing the genomes of environmental samples comprising many different
diverse organisms. Given the nature of metagenomic data, one usually has to
sequence the genomic material of all organisms in a batch, leading to a mix of
reads coming from different DNA sequences. In deep high-throughput sequencing
experiments, the volume of the raw reads is extremely high, frequently
exceeding 600 Gb. With an ever increasing demand for storing such reads for
future studies, the issue of efficient metagenomic compression becomes of
paramount importance. We present the first known approach to metagenome read
compression, termed MCUIUC (Metagenomic Compression at UIUC). The gist of the
proposed algorithm is to perform classification of reads based on unique
organism identifiers, followed by reference-based alignment of reads for
individually identified organisms, and metagenomic assembly of unclassified
reads. Once assembly and classification are completed, lossless reference based
compression is performed via positional encoding. We evaluate the performance
of the algorithm on moderate sized synthetic metagenomic samples involving 15
randomly selected organisms and describe future directions for improving the
proposed compression method.

    <title>featureCounts: An efficient general-purpose program for assigning
  sequence reads to genomic features</title>
    <summary>  Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence
reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications,
the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The
process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is
required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received
relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a read
summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or
genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient
chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster
than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)
and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or
paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different
sequencing applications. featureCounts is available under GNU General Public
License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread
(http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.

    <title>On the Reproducibility of TCGA Ovarian Cancer MicroRNA Profiles</title>
    <summary>  Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression is a well-established feature of
human cancer. However, the role of specific miRNAs in determining cancer
outcomes remains unclear. Using Level 3 expression data from the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA), we identified 61 miRNAs that are associated with overall survival
in 469 ovarian cancers profiled by microarray (p&lt;0.01). We also identified 12
miRNAs that are associated with survival when miRNAs were profiled in the same
specimens using Next Generation Sequencing (miRNA-Seq) (p&lt;0.01). Surprisingly,
only 1 miRNA transcript is associated with ovarian cancer survival in both
datasets. Our analyses indicate that this discrepancy is due to the fact that
miRNA levels reported by the two platforms correlate poorly, even after
correcting for potential issues inherent to signal detection algorithms.
Further investigation is warranted.

    <title>The genomic landscape of meiotic crossovers and gene conversions in
  Arabidopsis thaliana</title>
    <summary>  Knowledge of the exact distribution of meiotic crossovers (COs) and gene
conversions (GCs) is essential for understanding many aspects of population
genetics and evolution, from haplotype structure and long-distance genetic
linkage to the generation of new allelic variants of genes. To this end, we
resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled
haploids derived from Arabidopsis thaliana hybrids. GC detection through short
reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements. Rigid filtering
for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an
~80-kb transposition, which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic
recombination. Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due
to their short average length of ~25-50 bp, which is significantly shorter than
the length of CO associated GCs. Overall, recombination preferentially targeted
non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters, which showed
significant enrichment of two sequence motifs.

    <title>Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation</title>
    <summary>  DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer
genomes, and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying
tumor initiation and progression. Since the first release in 2001, the
Progenetix project (http://www.progenetix.org) has provided a reference
resource dedicated to provide the most comprehensive collection of genome-wide
CNA profiles. Reflecting the application of comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) techniques to tens of thousands of cancer genomes, over the past 12 years
our data curation efforts have resulted in a more than 60-fold increase in the
number of cancer samples presented through Progenetix. In addition, new data
exploration tools and visualization options have been added. In particular, the
gene specific CNA frequency analysis should facilitate the assignment of cancer
genes to related cancer types. Additionally, the new user file processing
interface allows users to take advantage of the online tools, including various
data representation options for proprietary data pre-publication. In this
update article, we report recent improvements of the database in terms of
content, user interface and online tools.

    <title>Improved annotation of 3-prime untranslated regions and complex loci by
  combination of strand-specific Direct RNA Sequencing, RNA-seq and ESTs</title>
    <summary>  The reference annotations made for a genome sequence provide the framework
for all subsequent analyses of the genome. Correct annotation is particularly
important when interpreting the results of RNA-seq experiments where short
sequence reads are mapped against the genome and assigned to genes according to
the annotation. Inconsistencies in annotations between the reference and the
experimental system can lead to incorrect interpretation of the effect on RNA
expression of an experimental treatment or mutation in the system under study.
Until recently, the genome-wide annotation of 3-prime untranslated regions
received less attention than coding regions and the delineation of intron/exon
boundaries. In this paper, data produced for samples in Human, Chicken and A.
thaliana by the novel single-molecule, strand-specific, Direct RNA Sequencing
technology from Helicos Biosciences which locates 3-prime polyadenylation sites
to within +/- 2 nt, were combined with archival EST and RNA-Seq data. Nine
examples are illustrated where this combination of data allowed: (1) gene and
3-prime UTR re-annotation (including extension of one 3-prime UTR by 5.9 kb);
(2) disentangling of gene expression in complex regions; (3) clearer
interpretation of small RNA expression and (4) identification of novel genes.
While the specific examples displayed here may become obsolete as genome
sequences and their annotations are refined, the principles laid out in this
paper will be of general use both to those annotating genomes and those seeking
to interpret existing publically available annotations in the context of their
own experimental data

    <title>Sequencing and characterisation of rearrangements in three S.
  pastorianus strains reveals the presence of chimeric genes and gives evidence
  of breakpoint reuse</title>
    <summary>  Gross chromosomal rearrangements have the potential to be evolutionarily
advantageous to an adapting organism. The generation of a hybrid species
increases opportunity for recombination by bringing together two homologous
genomes. We sought to define the location of genomic rearrangements in three
strains of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a natural lager-brewing yeast hybrid of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces eubayanus, using whole genome
shotgun sequencing. Each strain of S. pastorianus has lost species-specific
portions of its genome and has undergone extensive recombination, producing
chimeric chromosomes. We predicted 30 breakpoints that we confirmed at the
single nucleotide level by designing species-specific primers that flank each
breakpoint, and then sequencing the PCR product. These rearrangements are the
result of recombination between areas of homology between the two subgenomes,
rather than repetitive elements such as transposons or tRNAs. Interestingly,
28/30 S. cerevisiae- S. eubayanus recombination breakpoints are located within
genic regions, generating chimeric genes. Furthermore we show evidence for the
reuse of two breakpoints, located in HSP82 and KEM1, in strains of proposed
independent origin.

    <title>The hemagglutinin mutation E391K of pandemic 2009 influenza revisited</title>
    <summary>  Phylogenetic analyses based on small to moderately sized sets of sequential
data lead to overestimating mutation rates in influenza hemagglutinin (HA) by
at least an order of magnitude. Two major underlying reasons are: the
incomplete lineage sorting, and a possible absence in the analyzed sequences
set some of key missing ancestors. Additionally, during neighbor joining tree
reconstruction each mutation is considered equally important, regardless of its
nature. Here we have implemented a heuristic method optimizing site dependent
factors weighting differently 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codon position mutations,
allowing to extricate incorrectly attributed sub-clades. The least squares
regression analysis of distribution of frequencies for all mutations observed
on a partially disentangled tree for a large set of unique 3243 HA sequences,
along all nucleotide positions, was performed for all mutations as well as for
non-equivalent amino acid mutations: in both cases demonstrating almost flat
gradients, with a very slight downward slope towards the 3'-end positions. The
mean mutation rates per sequence per year were 3.83*10^-4 for the all
mutations, and 9.64*10^-5 for the non-equivalent ones.

    <title>Mapping of the Influenza-A Hemagglutinin Serotypes Evolution by the
  ISSCOR Method</title>
    <summary>  Analyses and visualizations by the ISSCOR method of influenza virus
hemagglutinin genes of different A-subtypes revealed some rather striking
temporal relationships between groups of individual gene subsets. Based on
these findings we consider application of the ISSCOR-PCA method for analyses of
large sets of homologous genes to be a worthwhile addition to a toolbox of
genomics - allowing for a rapid diagnostics of trends, and ultimately even
aiding an early warning of newly emerging epidemiological threats.

    <title>Parallel DNA Synthesis : Two PCR product from one DNA template</title>
    <summary>  Conventionally in a PCR reaction, Primers binds to DNA template in an
antiparallel manner and template DNA is amplified as it is. Here we describe an
approach in which First primer binds in a complementary parallel orientation
leading to synthesis in parallel direction. Further reaction happened in usual
way leading to synthesis of final DNA product having opposite polarity then the
template used. We first time proved that synthesis of DNA can happen in a
parallel orientation. We first time have shown that from a single DNA template,
Two different related PCR products can be synthesized.

    <summary>  We introduce a pipeline to easily generate collections of web accessible UCSC
genome browsers interrelated by an alignment. Using the alignment, all

    <title>Molecular responses of mouse macrophages to copper and copper oxide
  nanoparticles inferred from proteomic analyses</title>
    <summary>  The molecular responses of macrophages to copper-based nanoparticles have
been investigated via a combination of proteomic and biochemical approaches,
using the RAW264.7 cell line as a model. Both metallic copper and copper oxide
nanoparticles have been tested, with copper ion and zirconium oxide
nanoparticles used as controls. Proteomic analysis highlighted changes in
proteins implicated in oxidative stress responses (superoxide dismutases and
peroxiredoxins), glutathione biosynthesis, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and
mitochondrial proteins (especially oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits).
Validation studies employing functional analyses showed that the increases in
glutathione biosynthesis and in mitochondrial complexes observed in the
proteomic screen were critical to cell survival upon stress with copper-based
nanoparticles; pharmacological inhibition of these two pathways enhanced cell
vulnerability to copper-based nanoparticles, but not to copper ions.
Furthermore, functional analyses using primary macrophages derived from bone
marrow showed a decrease in reduced glutathione levels, a decrease in the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and inhibition of phagocytosis and of
lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production. However, only a fraction of
these effects could be obtained with copper ions. In conclusion, this study
showed that macrophage functions are significantly altered by copper-based
nanoparticles. Also highlighted are the cellular pathways modulated by cells
for survival and the exemplified cross-toxicities that can occur between
copper-based nanoparticles and pharmacological agents.

    <title>Bayesian Test for Colocalisation Between Pairs of Genetic Association
  Studies Using Summary Statistics</title>
    <summary>  Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study
design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide
range of human diseases and traits. The next challenge consists of
understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of
multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can
contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to
assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal
variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be
integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by
reanalysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published
meta-analysis of lipid traits including &gt;100, 000 individuals of European
ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our reanalysis supported 29 out of 38
reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation
results, highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In two cases of
reported eQTL-lipid pairs (IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that
the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify
alternative colocalisation results with GCKR and KPNB1, indicating that these
genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of
the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP
summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic
meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets
(http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about
candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for
the understanding of complex diseases and the design of drugs to target disease
pathways.

    <title>Late-replicating CNVs as a source of new genes</title>
    <summary>  Asynchronous replication of the genome has been associated with different
rates of point mutation and copy number variation (CNV) in human populations.
Here, we explored if the bias in the generation of CNV that is associated to
DNA replication timing might have conditioned the birth of new protein-coding
genes during evolution. We show that genes that were duplicated during primate
evolution are more commonly found among the human genes located in
late-replicating CNV regions. We traced the relationship between replication
timing and the evolutionary age of duplicated genes. Strikingly, we found that
there is a significant enrichment of evolutionary younger duplicates in late
replicating regions of the human and mouse genome. Indeed, the presence of
duplicates in late replicating regions gradually decreases as the evolutionary
time since duplication extends. Our results suggest that the accumulation of
recent duplications in late replicating CNV regions is an active process
influencing genome evolution.

    <title>Epigenetic regulation of repetitive DNA through mitotic asynchrony
  following double fertilization in angiosperms</title>
    <summary>  Several recent studies show that companion cells in flowering plant
gametophytes relax epigenetic control of transposable elements (TEs) to promote
production of small RNA that presumably assist nearby reproductive cells in
management of TEs. In light of this possibility, a closer look at the timing of
cell division in relation to angiosperm double fertilization is warranted. From
such an analysis, it is conceivable that double fertilization can drive
angiosperm evolution by facilitating crosses between genetically diverse
parents. A key feature of this ability is the order of cell division following
double fertilization, since division of the primary endosperm nucleus prior to
the zygote would produce small RNA capable of identifying TEs and defining
chromatin states in the zygote prior to its entry into S-phase of the cell
cycle. Consequently, crosses leading to increased ploidy or between genetically
diverse parents would yield offspring better capable of managing a diverse
complement of TEs and repetitive DNA. Considering double fertilization in this
regard challenges previous notions that the primary purpose of endosperm is for
improved seed reserve storage and utilization.

    <title>Can we predict the mutation rate at the single nucleotide scale in the
  human genome?</title>
    <summary>  It has been recently claimed that it is possible to predict the rate of de
novo mutation of each site in the human genome with almost perfect accuracy
(Michaelson et al. (2012) Cell, 151, 1431-1442). We show that this claim is
unwarranted. By considering the correlation between the rate of de novo
mutation and the predictions from the model of Michaelson et al., we show that
there could be substantial unexplained variance in the mutation rate. We also
demonstrate that the model of Michaelson et al. fails to capture a major
component of the variation in the mutation rate, that which is local but not
associated with simple context.

    <title>A Spatial Simulation Approach to Account for Protein Structure When
  Identifying Non-Random Somatic Mutations</title>
    <summary>  Background: Current research suggests that a small set of "driver" mutations
are responsible for tumorigenesis while a larger body of "passenger" mutations
occurs in the tumor but does not progress the disease. Due to recent
pharmacological successes in treating cancers caused by driver mutations, a
variety of of methodologies that attempt to identify such mutations have been
developed. Based on the hypothesis that driver mutations tend to cluster in key
regions of the protein, the development of cluster identification algorithms
has become critical.
  Results: We have developed a novel methodology, SpacePAC (Spatial Protein
Amino acid Clustering), that identifies mutational clustering by considering
the protein tertiary structure directly in 3D space. By combining the
mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and
the spatial information in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), SpacePAC is able to
identify novel mutation clusters in many proteins such as FGFR3 and CHRM2. In
addition, SpacePAC is better able to localize the most significant mutational
hotspots as demonstrated in the cases of BRAF and ALK. The R package is
available on Bioconductor at:
http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpacePAC.html
  Conclusion: SpacePAC adds a valuable tool to the identification of mutational
clusters while considering protein tertiary structure

    <title>ProbMetab: an R package for Bayesian probabilistic annotation of LC-MS
  based metabolomics</title>
    <summary>  We present ProbMetab, an R package which promotes substantial improvement in
automatic probabilistic LC-MS based metabolome annotation. The inference engine
core is based on a Bayesian model implemented to: (i) allow diverse source of
experimental data and metadata to be systematically incorporated into the model
with alternative ways to calculate the likelihood function and; (ii) allow
sensitive selection of biologically meaningful biochemical reactions databases
as Dirichlet-categorical prior distribution. Additionally, to ensure result
interpretation by system biologists, we display the annotation in a network
where observed mass peaks are connected if their candidate metabolites are
substrate/product of known biochemical reactions. This graph can be overlaid
with other graph-based analysis, such as partial correlation networks, in a
visualization scheme exported to Cytoscape, with web and stand alone versions.
ProbMetab was implemented in a modular fashion to fit together with established
upstream (xcms, CAMERA, AStream, mzMatch.R, etc) and downstream R package tools
(GeneNet, RCytoscape, DiffCorr, etc). ProbMetab, along with extensive
documentation and case studies, is freely available under GNU license at:
http://labpib.fmrp.usp.br/methods/probmetab/.

    <title>Cellular network entropy as the energy potential in Waddington's
  differentiation landscape</title>
    <summary>  Differentiation is a key cellular process in normal tissue development that
is significantly altered in cancer. Although molecular signatures
characterising pluripotency and multipotency exist, there is, as yet, no single
quantitative mark of a cellular sample's position in the global differentiation
hierarchy. Here we adopt a systems view and consider the sample's network
entropy, a measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, computable from a sample's
genome-wide expression profile. We demonstrate that network entropy provides a
quantitative, in-silico, readout of the average undifferentiated state of the
profiled cells, recapitulating the known hierarchy of pluripotent, multipotent
and differentiated cell types. Network entropy further exhibits dynamic changes
in time course differentiation data, and in line with a sample's
differentiation stage. In disease, network entropy predicts a higher level of
cellular plasticity in cancer stem cell populations compared to ordinary cancer
cells. Importantly, network entropy also allows identification of key
differentiation pathways. Our results are consistent with the view that
pluripotency is a statistical property defined at the cellular population
level, correlating with intra-sample heterogeneity, and driven by the degree of
signaling promiscuity in cells. In summary, network entropy provides a
quantitative measure of a cell's undifferentiated state, defining its elevation
in Waddington's landscape.

    <title>A feasible roadmap for unsupervised deconvolution of two-source mixed
  gene expressions</title>
    <summary>  Tissue heterogeneity is a major confounding factor in studying individual
populations that cannot be resolved directly by global profiling. Experimental
solutions to mitigate tissue heterogeneity are expensive, time consuming,
inapplicable to existing data, and may alter the original gene expression
patterns. Here we ask whether it is possible to deconvolute two-source mixed
expressions (estimating both proportions and cell-specific profiles) from two
or more heterogeneous samples without requiring any prior knowledge. Supported
by a well-grounded mathematical framework, we argue that both constituent
proportions and cell-specific expressions can be estimated in a completely
unsupervised mode when cell-specific marker genes exist, which do not have to
be known a priori, for each of constituent cell types. We demonstrate the
performance of unsupervised deconvolution on both simulation and real gene
expression data, together with perspective discussions.

    <title>Discovery of Phylogenetic Relevant Y-chromosome Variants in 1000 Genomes
  Project Data</title>
    <summary>  Current Y chromosome research is limited in the poor resolution of Y
chromosome phylogenetic tree. Entirely sequenced Y chromosomes in numerous
human individuals have only recently become available by the advent of
next-generation sequencing technology. The 1000 Genomes Project has sequenced Y
chromosomes from more than 1000 males. Here, we analyzed 1000 Genomes Project Y
chromosome data of 1269 individuals and discovered about 25,000 phylogenetic
relevant SNPs. Those new markers are useful in the phylogeny of Y chromosome
and will lead to an increased phylogenetic resolution for many Y chromosome
studies.

    <title>The Functional Consequences of Variation in Transcription Factor Binding</title>
    <summary>  One goal of human genetics is to understand how the information for precise
and dynamic gene expression programs is encoded in the genome. The interactions
of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory elements clearly play an
important role in determining gene expression outputs, yet the regulatory logic
underlying functional transcription factor binding is poorly understood. Many
studies have focused on characterizing the genomic locations of TF binding, yet
it is unclear to what extent TF binding at any specific locus has functional
consequences with respect to gene expression output. To evaluate the context of
functional TF binding we knocked down 59 TFs and chromatin modifiers in one
HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line. We then identified genes whose expression was
affected by the knockdowns. We intersected the gene expression data with
transcription factor binding data (based on ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) within 10
kb of the transcription start sites of expressed genes. This combination of
data allowed us to infer functional TF binding. On average, 14.7% of genes
bound by a factor were differentially expressed following the knockdown of that
factor, suggesting that most interactions between TF and chromatin do not
result in measurable changes in gene expression levels of putative target
genes. We found that functional TF binding is enriched in regulatory elements
that harbor a large number of TF binding sites, at sites with predicted higher
binding affinity, and at sites that are enriched in genomic regions annotated
as active enhancers.

    <title>A latent factor model with a mixture of sparse and dense factors to
  model gene expression data with confounding effects</title>
    <summary>  One important problem in genome science is to determine sets of co-regulated
genes based on measurements of gene expression levels across samples, where the
quantification of expression levels includes substantial technical and
biological noise. To address this problem, we developed a Bayesian sparse
latent factor model that uses a three parameter beta prior to flexibly model
shrinkage in the loading matrix. By applying three layers of shrinkage to the
loading matrix (global, factor-specific, and element-wise), this model has
non-parametric properties in that it estimates the appropriate number of
factors from the data. We added a two-component mixture to model each factor
loading as being generated from either a sparse or a dense mixture component;
this allows dense factors that capture confounding noise, and sparse factors
that capture local gene interactions. We developed two statistics to quantify
the stability of the recovered matrices for both sparse and dense matrices. We
tested our model on simulated data and found that we successfully recovered the
true latent structure as compared to related models. We applied our model to a
large gene expression study and found that we recovered known covariates and
small groups of co-regulated genes. We validated these gene subsets by testing
for associations between genotype data and these latent factors, and we found a
substantial number of biologically important genetic regulators for the
recovered gene subsets.

    <title>Bayesian genome assembly and assessment by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  sampling</title>
    <summary>  Most genome assemblers construct point estimates, choosing a genome sequence
from among many alternative hypotheses that are supported by the data. We
present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to sequence assembly that instead
generates distributions of assembly hypotheses with posterior probabilities,
providing an explicit statistical framework for evaluating alternative
hypotheses and assessing assembly uncertainty. We implement this approach in a
prototype assembler and illustrate its application to the bacteriophage
PhiX174.

    <title>Y Chromosomes of 40% Chinese Are Descendants of Three Neolithic
  Super-grandfathers</title>
    <summary>  Demographic change of human populations is one of the central questions for
delving into the past of human beings. To identify major population expansions
related to male lineages, we sequenced 78 East Asian Y chromosomes at 3.9 Mbp
of the non-recombining region (NRY), discovered &gt;4,000 new SNPs, and identified
many new clades. The relative divergence dates can be estimated much more
precisely using molecular clock. We found that all the Paleolithic divergences
were binary; however, three strong star-like Neolithic expansions at ~6 kya
(thousand years ago) (assuming a constant substitution rate of 1e-9/bp/year)
indicates that ~40% of modern Chinese are patrilineal descendants of only three
super-grandfathers at that time. This observation suggests that the main
patrilineal expansion in China occurred in the Neolithic Era and might be
related to the development of agriculture.

    <title>Identification of cromosomal translocation hotspots via scan statistics</title>
    <summary>  The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an
important undertaking in the analysis of next generation sequencing data.
Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated B lymphocytes have
identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A
quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was
crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple
probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the
number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our
method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide significance level to
clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. Whilst
being motivated by a specific application, the detection of unusual clusters is
a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in
the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and
4C-seq.

    <title>Routes for breaching and protecting genetic privacy</title>
    <summary>  We are entering the era of ubiquitous genetic information for research,
clinical care, and personal curiosity. Sharing these datasets is vital for
rapid progress in understanding the genetic basis of human diseases. However,
one growing concern is the ability to protect the genetic privacy of the data
originators. Here, we technically map threats to genetic privacy and discuss
potential mitigation strategies for privacy-preserving dissemination of genetic
data.

    <title>IQRray, a new method for Affymetrix microarray quality control, and the
  homologous organ conservation score, a new benchmark method for quality
  control metrics</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Microarray results accumulated in public repositories are widely
re-used in meta-analytical studies and secondary databases. The quality of the
data obtained with this technology varies from experiment to experiment and
efficient method for quality assessment is neces-sary to ensure their
reliability. Results: The lack of a good benchmark has hampered evaluation of
existing methods for quality control. In this study we propose a new
inde-pendent quality metric that is based on evolutionary conservation of
expression profiles. We show, using 11 large organ-specific datasets, that
IQRray, a new quality metrics developed by us, exhibits the highest correlation
with this reference metric, among 14 metrics tested. IQRray outperforms other
methods in identification of poor quality arrays in dataset composed of arrays
from many independent experiments. In con-trast, the performance of methods
designed for detecting outliers in a single experiment like NUSE and RLE was
low because of the inability of these method to detect datasets containing only
low quality arrays, and the fact that the scores cannot be directly compared
between ex-periments. Availability: The R implementation of IQRray is available
at: ftp://lausanne.isb-sib.ch/pub/databases/Bgee/general/IQRray.R

    <title>An age-of-allele test of neutrality for transposable element insertions</title>
    <summary>  How natural selection acts to limit the proliferation of transposable
elements (TEs) in genomes has been of interest to evolutionary biologists for
many years. To describe TE dynamics in populations, many previous studies have
used models of transposition-selection equilibrium that rely on the assumption
of a constant rate of transposition. However, since TE invasions are known to
happen in bursts through time, this assumption may not be reasonable in natural
populations. Here we propose a test of neutrality for TE insertions that does
not rely on the assumption of a constant transposition rate. We consider the
case of TE insertions that have been ascertained from a single haploid
reference genome sequence and have subsequently had their allele frequency
estimated in a population sample. By conditioning on the age of an individual
TE insertion (using information contained in the number of substitutions that
have occurred within the TE sequence since insertion), we determine the
probability distribution for the insertion allele frequency in a population
sample under neutrality. Taking models of varying population size into account,
we then evaluate predictions of our model against allele frequency data from
190 retrotransposon insertions sampled from North American and African
populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this non-equilibrium model, we
are able to explain about 80% of the variance in TE insertion allele
frequencies based on age alone. Controlling both for nonequilibrium dynamics of
transposition and host demography, we provide evidence for negative selection
acting against most TEs as well as for positive selection acting on a small
subset of TEs. Our work establishes a new framework for the analysis of the
evolutionary forces governing large insertion mutations like TEs, gene
duplications or other copy number variants.

    <title>Joint assembly and genetic mapping of the Atlantic horseshoe crab genome
  reveals ancient whole genome duplication</title>
    <summary>  Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods with a fossil record extending back
approximately 450 million years. They exhibit remarkable morphological
stability over their long evolutionary history, retaining a number of ancestral
arthropod traits, and are often cited as examples of "living fossils." As
arthropods, they belong to the Ecdysozoa}, an ancient super-phylum whose
sequenced genomes (including insects and nematodes) have thus far shown more
divergence from the ancestral pattern of eumetazoan genome organization than
cnidarians, deuterostomes, and lophotrochozoans. However, much of ecdysozoan
diversity remains unrepresented in comparative genomic analyses. Here we use a
new strategy of combined de novo assembly and genetic mapping to examine the
chromosome-scale genome organization of the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus
polyphemus. We constructed a genetic linkage map of this 2.7 Gbp genome by
sequencing the nuclear DNA of 34 wild-collected, full-sibling embryos and their
parents at a mean redundancy of 1.1x per sample. The map includes 84,307
sequence markers and 5,775 candidate conserved protein coding genes. Comparison
to other metazoan genomes shows that the L. polyphemus genome preserves
ancestral bilaterian linkage groups, and that a common ancestor of modern
horseshoe crabs underwent one or more ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs)
~ 300 MYA, followed by extensive chromosome fusion.

    <title>Integrating diverse datasets improves developmental enhancer prediction</title>
    <summary>  Gene-regulatory enhancers have been identified by many lines of evidence,
including evolutionary conservation, regulatory protein binding, chromatin
modifications, and DNA sequence motifs. To integrate these different
approaches, we developed EnhancerFinder, a novel method for predicting
developmental enhancers and their tissue specificity. EnhancerFinder uses a
two-step multiple-kernel learning approach to integrate DNA sequence motifs,
evolutionary patterns, and thousands of diverse functional genomics datasets
from a variety of cell types and developmental stages. We trained
EnhancerFinder on hundreds of experimentally verified human developmental
enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, in contrast to histone mark or
sequence-based enhancer definitions commonly used. We comprehensively evaluated
EnhancerFinder, and found that our integrative approach improves enhancer
prediction accuracy over previous approaches that consider a single type of
data. Our evaluation highlights the importance of considering information from
many tissues when predicting specific types of enhancers. We find that VISTA
enhancers active in embryonic heart are easier to predict than enhancers active
in several other tissues due to their uniquely high GC content. We applied
EnhancerFinder to the entire human genome and predicted 84,301 developmental
enhancers and their tissue specificity. These predictions provide specific
functional annotations for large amounts of human non-coding DNA, and are
significantly enriched near genes with annotated roles in their predicted
tissues and hits from genome-wide association studies. We demonstrate the
utility of our enhancer predictions by identifying and validating a novel
cranial nerve enhancer in the ZEB2 locus. Our genome-wide developmental
enhancer predictions will be freely available as a UCSC Genome Browser track.

    <title>A computational model for histone mark propagation reproduces the
  distribution of heterochromatin in different human cell types</title>
    <summary>  Chromatin is a highly compact and dynamic nuclear structure that consists of
DNA and associated proteins. The main organizational unit is the nucleosome,
which consists of a histone octamer with DNA wrapped around it. Histone
proteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry
numerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein
interactions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins.
Heterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely
packed and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The
propagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing
by methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines,
which is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related
histone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale. These histone
marks are assumed to be initiated within distinct nucleation sites in the DNA
and to propagate bi-directionally. We propose a simple computer model that
simulates the distribution of heterochromatin in human chromosomes. The
simulations are in agreement with previously reported experimental observations
from two different human cell lines. We reproduced different types of barriers
between heterochromatin and euchromatin providing a unified model for their
function. The effect of changes in the nucleation site distribution and of
propagation rates were studied. The former occurs mainly with the aim of
(de-)activation of single genes or gene groups and the latter has the power of
controlling the transcriptional programs of entire chromosomes. Generally, the
regulatory program of gene transcription is controlled by the distribution of
nucleation sites along the DNA string.

    <title>The epigenome of evolving Drosophila neo-sex chromosomes: dosage
  compensation and heterochromatin formation</title>
    <summary>  Drosophila Y chromosomes are composed entirely of silent heterochromatin,
while male X chromosomes have highly accessible chromatin and are
hypertranscribed due to dosage compensation. Here, we dissect the molecular
mechanisms and functional pressures driving heterochromatin formation and
dosage compensation of the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila
miranda. We show that the onset of heterochromatin formation on the neo-Y is
triggered by an accumulation of repetitive DNA. The neo-X has evolved partial
dosage compensation and we find that diverse mutational paths have been
utilized to establish several dozen novel binding consensus motifs for the
dosage compensation complex on the neo-X, including simple point mutations at
pre-binding sites, insertion and deletion mutations, microsatellite expansions,
or tandem amplification of weak binding sites. Spreading of these silencing or
activating chromatin modifications to adjacent regions results in massive
mis-expression of neo-sex linked genes, and little correspondence between
functionality of genes and their silencing on the neo-Y or dosage compensation
on the neo-X. Intriguingly, the genomic regions being targeted by the dosage
compensation complex on the neo-X and those becoming heterochromatic on the
neo-Y show little overlap, possibly reflecting different propensities along the
ancestral chromosome to adopt active or repressive chromatin configurations.
Our findings have broad implications for current models of sex chromosome
evolution, and demonstrate how mechanistic constraints can limit evolutionary
adaptations. Our study also highlights how evolution can follow predictable
genetic trajectories, by repeatedly acquiring the same 21-bp consensus motif
for recruitment of the dosage compensation complex, yet utilizing a diverse
array of random mutational changes to attain the same phenotypic outcome.

    <title>Reliable reconstruction of HIV-1 whole genome haplotypes reveals clonal
  interference and genetic hitchhiking among immune escape variants</title>
    <summary>  Following transmission, HIV-1 evolves into a diverse population, and next
generation sequencing enables us to detect variants occurring at low
frequencies. Studying viral evolution at the level of whole genomes was
hitherto not possible because next generation sequencing delivers relatively
short reads. We here provide a proof of principle that whole HIV-1 genomes can
be reliably reconstructed from short reads, and use this to study the selection
of immune escape mutations at the level of whole genome haplotypes. Using
realistically simulated HIV-1 populations, we demonstrate that reconstruction
of complete genome haplotypes is feasible with high fidelity. We do not
reconstruct all genetically distinct genomes, but each reconstructed haplotype
represents one or more of the quasispecies in the HIV-1 population. We then
reconstruct 30 whole genome haplotypes from published short sequence reads
sampled longitudinally from a single HIV-1 infected patient. We confirm the
reliability of the reconstruction by validating our predicted haplotype genes
with single genome amplification sequences, and by comparing haplotype
frequencies with observed epitope escape frequencies. Phylogenetic analysis
shows that the HIV-1 population undergoes selection driven evolution, with
successive replacement of the viral population by novel dominant strains. We
demonstrate that immune escape mutants evolve in a dependent manner with
various mutations hitchhiking along with others. As a consequence of this
clonal interference, selection coefficients have to be estimated for complete
haplotypes and not for individual immune escapes.

    <title>Accurate Profiling of Microbial Communities from Massively Parallel
  Sequencing using Convex Optimization</title>
    <summary>  We describe the Microbial Community Reconstruction ({\bf MCR}) Problem, which
is fundamental for microbiome analysis. In this problem, the goal is to
reconstruct the identity and frequency of species comprising a microbial
community, using short sequence reads from Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS)
data obtained for specified genomic regions. We formulate the problem
mathematically as a convex optimization problem and provide sufficient
conditions for identifiability, namely the ability to reconstruct species
identity and frequency correctly when the data size (number of reads) grows to
infinity. We discuss different metrics for assessing the quality of the
reconstructed solution, including a novel phylogenetically-aware metric based
on the Mahalanobis distance, and give upper-bounds on the reconstruction error
for a finite number of reads under different metrics. We propose a scalable
divide-and-conquer algorithm for the problem using convex optimization, which
enables us to handle large problems (with $\sim10^6$ species). We show using
numerical simulations that for realistic scenarios, where the microbial
communities are sparse, our algorithm gives solutions with high accuracy, both
in terms of obtaining accurate frequency, and in terms of species phylogenetic
resolution.

    <title>mTim: Rapid and accurate transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq data</title>
    <summary>  Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology have
revolutionized transcriptome studies. A major motivation for RNA-Seq is to map
the structure of expressed transcripts at nucleotide resolution. With accurate
computational tools for transcript reconstruction, this technology may also
become useful for genome (re-)annotation, which has mostly relied on de novo
gene finding where gene structures are primarily inferred from the genome
sequence. We developed a machine-learning method, called mTim (margin-based
transcript inference method) for transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq read
alignments that is based on discriminatively trained hidden Markov support
vector machines. In addition to features derived from read alignments, it
utilizes characteristic genomic sequences, e.g. around splice sites, to improve
transcript predictions. mTim inferred transcripts that were highly accurate and
relatively robust to alignment errors in comparison to those from Cufflinks, a
widely used transcript assembly method.

    <title>A Comparative Analysis of Ensemble Classifiers: Case Studies in Genomics</title>
    <summary>  The combination of multiple classifiers using ensemble methods is
increasingly important for making progress in a variety of difficult prediction
problems. We present a comparative analysis of several ensemble methods through
two case studies in genomics, namely the prediction of genetic interactions and
protein functions, to demonstrate their efficacy on real-world datasets and
draw useful conclusions about their behavior. These methods include simple
aggregation, meta-learning, cluster-based meta-learning, and ensemble selection
using heterogeneous classifiers trained on resampled data to improve the
diversity of their predictions. We present a detailed analysis of these methods
across 4 genomics datasets and find the best of these methods offer
statistically significant improvements over the state of the art in their
respective domains. In addition, we establish a novel connection between
ensemble selection and meta-learning, demonstrating how both of these disparate
methods establish a balance between ensemble diversity and performance.

    <title>Amino Acid Distributions and the Effect of Optimal Growth Temperature</title>
    <summary>  We perform an exhaustive analysis of genome statistics for organisms,
particularly extremophiles, growing in a wide range of physicochemical
conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate how the correlation between the
frequency of amino acids and their molecular weight, preserved on average,
typically decreases as optimal growth temperature increases. We show how the
relation between codon degeneracy and amino acid mass is enforced across these
organisms. We assess the occurrence of contiguous amino acids, finding several
significant short words, often containing cysteine, histidine or proline.
Typically, the significance of these words is independent of growth
temperature. In a novel approach, first-passage distributions are used to
capture correlations between discontiguous residues. We find a nearly universal
exponential background that we relate to properties of the aforementioned
individual amino acid frequencies. We find this approach reliably extracts
correlations that depend on growth temperature, some of which have not been
previously characterized.

    <title>A Realistic Model under which the Genetic Code is Optimal</title>
    <summary>  The genetic code has a high level of error robustness. Using values of
hydrophobicity scales as a proxy for amino acid character, and the Mean Square
measure as a function quantifying error robustness, a value can be obtained for
a genetic code which reflects the error robustness of that code. By comparing
this value with a distribution of values belonging to codes generated by random
permutations of amino acid assignments, the level of error robustness of a
genetic code can be quantified. We present a calculation in which the standard
genetic code is shown to be optimal. We obtain this result by (1) using
recently updated values of polar requirement as input; (2) fixing seven
assignments (Ile, Trp, His, Phe, Tyr, Arg, and Leu) based on aptamer
considerations; and (3) using known biosynthetic relations of the 20 amino
acids. This last point is reflected in an approach of subdivision (restricting
the random reallocation of assignments to amino acid subgroups, the set of 20
being divided in four such subgroups). The three approaches to explain
robustness of the code (specific selection for robustness, amino acid-RNA
interactions leading to assignments, or a slow growth process of assignment
patterns) are reexamined in light of our findings. We offer a comprehensive
hypothesis, stressing the importance of biosynthetic relations, with the code
evolving from an early stage with just glycine and alanine, via intermediate
stages, towards 64 codons carrying todays meaning.

    <title>Centromere reference models for human chromosomes X and Y satellite
  arrays</title>
    <summary>  The human genome remains incomplete, with multi-megabase sized gaps
representing the endogenous centromeres and other heterochromatic regions.
These regions are commonly enriched with long arrays of near-identical tandem
repeats, known as satellite DNAs, that offer a limited number of variant sites
to differentiate individual repeat copies across millions of bases. This
substantial sequence homogeneity challenges available assembly strategies, and
as a result, centromeric regions are omitted from ongoing genomic studies. To
address this problem, we present a locally ordered assembly across two haploid
human satellite arrays on chromosomes X and Y, resulting in an initial linear
representation of 3.83 Mb of centromeric DNA within an individual genome. To
further expand the utility of each centromeric reference sequence, we evaluate
sites within the arrays for short-read mappability and chromosome specificity.
As satellite DNAs evolve in a concerted manner, we use these centromeric
assemblies to assess the extent of sequence variation among 372 individuals
from distinct human populations. In doing so, we identify two ancient satellite
array variants in both X and Y centromeres as determined by array length and
sequence composition. This study provides an initial linear representation and
comprehensive sequence characterization of a regional centromere and
establishes a foundation to extend genomic characterization to these sites as
well as to other repeat-rich regions within complex genomes.

    <title>Metabolic evolution of a deep-branching hyperthermophilic
  chemoautotrophic bacterium</title>
    <summary>  Aquifex aeolicus is a deep-branching hyperthermophilic chemoautotrophic
bacterium restricted to hydrothermal vents and hot springs. These
characteristics make it an excellent model system for studying the early
evolution of metabolism. Here we present the whole-genome metabolic network of
this organism and examine in detail the driving forces that have shaped it. We
make extensive use of phylometabolic analysis, a method we recently introduced
that generates trees of metabolic phenotypes by integrating phylogenetic and
metabolic constraints. We reconstruct the evolution of a range of metabolic
sub-systems, including the reductive citric acid (rTCA) cycle, as well as the
biosynthesis and functional roles of several amino acids and cofactors. We show
that A. aeolicus uses the reconstructed ancestral pathways within many of these
sub-systems, and highlight how the evolutionary interconnections between
sub-systems facilitated several key innovations. Our analyses further highlight
three general classes of driving forces in metabolic evolution. One is the
duplication and divergence of genes for enzymes as these progress from lower to
higher substrate specificity, improving the kinetics of certain sub-systems. A
second is the kinetic optimization of established pathways through fusion of
enzymes, or their organization into larger complexes. The third is the
minimization of the ATP unit cost to synthesize biomass, improving
thermodynamic efficiency. Quantifying the distribution of these classes of
innovations across metabolic sub-systems and across the tree of life will allow
us to assess how a tradeoff between maximizing growth rate and growth
efficiency has shaped the long-term metabolic evolution of the biosphere.

    <title>DNA viewed as an out-of-equilibrium structure</title>
    <summary>  The complexity of the primary structure of human DNA is explored using
methods from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, dynamical systems theory and
information theory. The use of chi-square tests shows that DNA cannot be
described as a low order Markov chain of order up to $r=6$. Although detailed
balance seems to hold at the level of purine-pyrimidine notation it fails when
all four basepairs are considered, suggesting spatial asymmetry and
irreversibility. Furthermore, the block entropy does not increase linearly with
the block size, reflecting the long range nature of the correlations in the
human genomic sequences. To probe locally the spatial structure of the chain we
study the exit distances from a specific symbol, the distribution of recurrence
distances and the Hurst exponent, all of which show power law tails and long
range characteristics. These results suggest that human DNA can be viewed as a
non-equilibrium structure maintained in its state through interactions with a
constantly changing environment. Based solely on the exit distance distribution
accounting for the nonequilibrium statistics and using the Monte Carlo
rejection sampling method we construct a model DNA sequence. This method allows
to keep all long range and short range statistical characteristics of the
original sequence. The model sequence presents the same characteristic
exponents as the natural DNA but fails to capture point-to-point details.

    <title>Fast and accurate imputation of summary statistics enhances evidence of
  functional enrichment</title>
    <summary>  Imputation using external reference panels is a widely used approach for
increasing power in GWAS and meta-analysis. Existing HMM-based imputation
approaches require individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method
for Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type of data
that is becoming widely available. In simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G)
data, this method recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size for common
(&gt;5%) and low-frequency (1-5%) variants (increasing to 87% (60%) when summary
LD information is available from target samples) versus 89% (67%) for HMM-based
imputation, which cannot be applied to summary statistics. Our approach
accounts for the limited sample size of the reference panel, a crucial step to
eliminate false-positive associations, and is computationally very fast. As an
empirical demonstration, we apply our method to 7 case-control phenotypes from
the WTCCC data and a study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC).
Gaussian imputation from summary statistics recovers 95% (105%) of the
effective sample size (as quantified by the ratio of $\chi^2$ association
statistics) compared to HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes at
the 227 (176) published SNPs in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition,
for publicly available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of 4 lipid
traits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which
could not have been obtained using previously published methods, and
demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G
imputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical evidence
of enrichment at genic vs. non-genic loci for these traits, as compared to an
analysis without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will
be a valuable tool in future functional enrichment analyses.

    <title>Poly-Omic Prediction of Complex Traits: OmicKriging</title>
    <summary>  High-confidence prediction of complex traits such as disease risk or drug
response is an ultimate goal of personalized medicine. Although genome-wide
association studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms
associated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive
power of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of
clinical relevance. We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait
prediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic,
transcriptomic or other omics-level data. We translate the omic similarity into
phenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in
geostatistics and machine learning. Our method called OmicKriging emphasizes
the use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly
made available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome and
epigenome, for complex trait prediction. Furthermore, our OmicKriging framework
allows easy integration of prior information on the function of subsets of
omics-level data from heterogeneous sources without the sometimes heavy
computational burden of Bayesian approaches. Using seven disease datasets from
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging
allows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding
comparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently
published Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method. Using a cellular growth
phenotype, we show that integrating mRNA and microRNA expression data
substantially increases performance over either dataset alone. We also
integrate genotype and expression data to predict change in LDL cholesterol
levels after statin treatment and show that OmicKriging performs better than
the polygenic score method. We provide an R package to implement OmicKriging.

    <title>Statistical data mining for symbol associations in genomic databases</title>
    <summary>  A methodology is proposed to automatically detect significant symbol
associations in genomic databases. A new statistical test is proposed to assess
the significance of a group of symbols when found in several genesets of a
given database. Applied to symbol pairs, the thresholded p-values of the test
define a graph structure on the set of symbols. The cliques of that graph are
significant symbol associations, linked to a set of genesets where they can be
found. The method can be applied to any database, and is illustrated MSigDB C2
database. Many of the symbol associations detected in C2 or in non-specific
selections did correspond to already known interactions. On more specific
selections of C2, many previously unkown symbol associations have been
detected. These associations unveal new candidates for gene or protein
interactions, needing further investigation for biological evidence.

    <title>Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE fractionation of biological samples for
  biomarker discovery</title>
    <summary>  Two-dimensional electrophoresis is still a very valuable tool in proteomics,
due to its reproducibility and its ability to analyze complete proteins.
However, due to its sensitivity to dynamic range issues, its most suitable use
in the frame of biomarker discovery is not on very complex fluids such as
plasma, but rather on more proximal, simpler fluids such as CSF, urine, or
secretome samples. Here, we describe the complete workflow for the analysis of
such dilute samples by two-dimensional electrophoresis, starting from sample
concentration, then the two-dimensional electrophoresis step per se, ending
with the protein detection by fluorescence.

    <title>Fast and Exact Sequence Alignment with the Smith-Waterman Algorithm: The
  SwissAlign Webserver</title>
    <summary>  It is demonstrated earlier that the exact Smith-Waterman algorithm yields
more accurate results than the members of the heuristic BLAST family of
algorithms. Unfortunately, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is much slower than the
BLAST and its clones. Here we present a technique and a webserver that uses the
exact Smith-Waterman algorithm, and it is approximately as fast as the BLAST
algorithm. The technique unites earlier methods of extensive preprocessing of
the target sequence database, and CPU-specific coding of the Smith-Waterman
algorithm. The SwissAlign webserver is available at the
http://swissalign.pitgroup.org address.

    <title>Information Measures for Long-Range Correlated Sequences: the Case of
  the 24 Human Chromosome Sequences</title>
    <summary>  A new approach to estimate the Shannon entropy of a long-range correlated
sequence is proposed. The entropy is written as the sum of two terms
corresponding respectively to power-law (\emph{ordered}) and exponentially
(\emph{disordered}) distributed blocks (clusters). The approach is illustrated
on the 24 human chromosome sequences by taking the nucleotide composition as
the relevant information to be encoded/decoded. Interestingly, the nucleotide
composition of the \emph{ordered} clusters is found, on the average, comparable
to the one of the whole analyzed sequence, while that of the \emph{disordered}
clusters fluctuates. From the information theory standpoint, this means that
the power-law correlated clusters carry the same information of the whole
analysed sequence. Furthermore, the fluctuations of the nucleotide composition
of the disordered clusters are linked to relevant biological properties, such
as segmental duplications and gene density.

    <title>Control of ribosome traffic by position-dependent choice of synonymous
  codons</title>
    <summary>  Messenger RNA encodes a sequence of amino acids by using codons. For most
amino acids there are multiple synonymous codons that can encode the amino
acid. The translation speed can vary from one codon to another, thus there is
room for changing the ribosome speed while keeping the amino acid sequence and
hence the resulting protein. Recently, it has been noticed that the choice of
the synonymous codon, via the resulting distribution of slow- and
fast-translated codons, affects not only on the average speed of one ribosome
translating the messenger RNA (mRNA) but also might have an effect on nearby
ribosomes by affecting the appearance of "traffic jams" where multiple
ribosomes collide and form queues. To test this "context effect" further, we
here investigate the effect of the sequence of synonymous codons on the
ribosome traffic by using a ribosome traffic model with codon-dependent rates,
estimated from experiments. We compare the ribosome traffic on wild type
sequences and sequences where the synonymous codons were swapped randomly. By
simulating translation of 87 genes, we demonstrate that the wild type
sequences, especially those with a high bias in codon usage, tend to have the
ability to reduce ribosome collisions, hence optimizing the cellular investment
in the translation apparatus. The magnitude of such reduction of the
translation time might have a significant impact on the cellular growth rate
and thereby have importance for the survival of the species.

    <title>Lineage specific reductions in genome size in salamanders are associated
  with increased rates of mutation</title>
    <summary>  Very low levels of genetic diversity have been reported in vertebrates with
large genomes, notably salamanders and lungfish [1-3]. Interpreting differences
in heterozygosity, which reflects genetic diversity in a population, is
complicated because levels of heterozygosity vary widely between conspecific
populations, and correlate with many different physiological and demographic
variables such as body size and effective population size. Here we return to
the question of genetic variability in salamanders and report on the
relationship between evolutionary rates and genome sizes in five different
salamander families. We found that rates of evolution are exceptionally low in
salamanders as a group. Evolutionary rates are as low as those reported for
cartilaginous fish, which have the slowest rates recorded so far in vertebrates
[4]. We also found that, independent of life history, salamanders with the
smallest genomes (14 pg) are evolving at rates two to three times faster than
salamanders with the largest genomes (&gt;50 pg). After accounting for
evolutionary duration, we conclude that more recently evolved species have
correspondingly smaller genomes compared to older taxa and concomitantly higher
rates of mutation and evolution.

    <title>Genetic recombination is targeted towards gene promoter regions in dogs</title>
    <summary>  The identification of the H3K4 trimethylase, PRDM9, as the gene responsible
for recombination hotspot localization has provided considerable insight into
the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However,
uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9
and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs
in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the
recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from
patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data
from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties
of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale
estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed
in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show
little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes.
By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show
that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG
content of the dog genome could have occurred.

    <title>The role of mutation rate variation and genetic diversity in the
  architecture of human disease</title>
    <summary>  We have investigated the role that the mutation rate and the structure of
genetic variation at a locus play in determining whether a gene is involved in
disease. We predict that the mutation rate and its genetic diversity should be
higher in genes associated with disease, unless all genes that could cause
disease have already been identified. Consistent with our predictions we find
that genes associated with Mendelian and complex disease are substantially
longer than non-disease genes. However, we find that both Mendelian and complex
disease genes are found in regions of the genome with relatively low mutation
rates, as inferred from intron divergence between humans and chimpanzees.
Complex disease gene are predicted to have higher rates of non-synonymous
mutation than non-disease genes, but the opposite pattern is found in Mendelian
disease genes. Finally, we find that disease genes are in regions of
significantly elevated genetic diversity, even when variation in the rate of
mutation is controlled for. The effect is small nevertheless. Our results
suggest that variation in the genic mutation rate and the genetic architecture
of the locus play a minor role in determining whether a gene is associated with
disease.

    <title>Positive selection drives faster-Z evolution in silkmoths</title>
    <summary>  Genes linked to X or Z chromosomes, which are hemizygous in the heterogametic
sex, are predicted to evolve at different rates than those on autosomes. This
faster-X effect can arise either as a consequence of hemizygosity, which leads
to more efficient selection for recessive beneficial mutations in the
heterogametic sex, or as a consequence of reduced effective population size of
the hemizygous chromosome, which leads to increased fixation of weakly
deleterious mutations due to random genetic drift. Empirical results to date
have suggested that, while the overall pattern across taxa is complicated, in
general systems with male-heterogamy show a faster-X effect primarily
attributable to more efficient selection while the only female-heterogamy taxon
studied to date (birds) shows a faster-Z effect primarily attributable to
increased drift. In order to test the generality of the faster-Z pattern seen
in birds, we sequenced the genome of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx huttoni, a
close outgroup of the domesticated silkmoth Bombyx mori. We show that silkmoths
experience faster-Z evolution, but unlike in birds, the faster-Z effect appears
to be attributable to more efficient positive selection in females. These
results suggest that female-heterogamy alone is unlikely to be sufficient to
explain the reduced efficacy of selection on the bird Z chromosome. Instead, it
is likely that a combination of patterns of dosage compensation and overall
effective population size, among other factors, influence patterns of faster-Z
evolution.

    <title>TreeOTU: Operational Taxonomic Unit Classification Based on Phylogenetic
  Trees</title>
    <summary>  Our current understanding of the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of
cellular organisms, especially the bacteria and archaea, is mostly based upon
studies of sequences of the small- subunit rRNAs (ssu-rRNAs). To address the
limitation of ssu-rRNA as a phylogenetic marker, such as copy number variation
among organisms and complications introduced by horizontal gene transfer,
convergent evolution, or evolution rate variations, we have identified protein-
coding gene families as alternative Phylogenetic and Phylogenetic Ecology
markers (PhyEco). Current nucleotide sequence similarity based Operational
Taxonomic Unit (OTU) classification methods are not readily applicable to amino
acid sequences of PhyEco markers. We report here the development of TreeOTU, a
phylogenetic tree structure based OTU classification method that takes into
account of differences in rates of evolution between taxa and between genes.
OTU sets built by TreeOTU are more faithful to phylogenetic tree structures
than sequence clustering (non phylogenetic) methods for ssu-rRNAs. OTUs built
from phylogenetic trees of protein coding PhyEco markers are comparable to our
current taxonomic classification at different levels. With the included OTU
comparing tools, the TreeOTU is robust in phylogenetic referencing with
different phylogenetic markers and trees.

    <title>Application of Volcano Plots in Analyses of mRNA Differential
  Expressions with Microarrays</title>
    <summary>  Volcano plot displays unstandardized signal (e.g. log-fold-change) against
noise-adjusted/standardized signal (e.g. t-statistic or -log10(p-value) from
the t test). We review the basic and an interactive use of the volcano plot,
and its crucial role in understanding the regularized t-statistic. The joint
filtering gene selection criterion based on regularized statistics has a curved
discriminant line in the volcano plot, as compared to the two perpendicular
lines for the "double filtering" criterion. This review attempts to provide an
unifying framework for discussions on alternative measures of differential
expression, improved methods for estimating variance, and visual display of a
microarray analysis result. We also discuss the possibility to apply volcano
plots to other fields beyond microarray.

    <title>Diminishing Return for Increased Mappability with Longer Sequencing
  Reads: Implications of the k-mer Distributions in the Human Genome</title>
    <summary>  The amount of non-unique sequence (non-singletons) in a genome directly
affects the difficulty of read alignment to a reference assembly for high
throughput-sequencing data. Although a greater length increases the chance for
reads being uniquely mapped to the reference genome, a quantitative analysis of
the influence of read lengths on mappability has been lacking. To address this
question, we evaluate the k-mer distribution of the human reference genome. The
k-mer frequency is determined for k ranging from 20 to 1000 basepairs. We use
the proportion of non-singleton k-mers to evaluate the mappability of reads for
a corresponding read length. We observe that the proportion of non-singletons
decreases slowly with increasing k, and can be fitted by piecewise power-law
functions with different exponents at different k ranges. A faster decay at
smaller values for k indicates more limited gains for read lengths &gt; 200
basepairs. The frequency distributions of k-mers exhibit long tails in a
power-law-like trend, and rank frequency plots exhibit a concave Zipf's curve.
The location of the most frequent 1000-mers comprises 172 kilobase-ranged
regions, including four large stretches on chromosomes 1 and X, containing
genes with biomedical implications. Even the read length 1000 would be
insufficient to reliably sequence these specific regions.

    <title>Lognormality and oscillations in the coverage of high-throughput
  transcriptomic data towards gene ends</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput transcriptomics experiments have reached the stage where the
count of the number of reads alignable to a given position can be treated as an
almost-continuous signal. This allows to ask questions of
biophysical/biotechnical nature, but which may still have biological
implications. Here we show that when sequencing RNA fragments from one end, as
it is the case on most platforms, an oscillation in the read count is observed
at the other end. We further show that these oscillations can be well described
by Kolmogorov's 1941 broken stick model. We investigate how the model can be
used to improve predictions of gene ends (3' transcript ends) but conclude that
with present data the improvement is only marginal. The results highlight
subtle effects in high-throughput transcriptomics experiments which do not have
a biological origin, but which may still be used to obtain biological
information.

    <title>A network approach to analyzing highly recombinant malaria parasite
  genes</title>
    <summary>  The var genes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum present a
challenge to population geneticists due to their extreme diversity, which is
generated by high rates of recombination. These genes encode a primary antigen
protein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood
cells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are
characterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional
phylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary
relationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions
(HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a
node and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant
length. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have
a uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce
network communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We
validate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers
populations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy
Binding Like-{\alpha} (DBL{\alpha}) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs
whose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBL{\alpha}
classifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational
constraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These
findings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent
evolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite
to retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our
approach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary
constraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more
generally to any highly recombinant sequences.

    <title>Genome wide signals of pervasive positive selection in human evolution</title>
    <summary>  The role of positive selection in human evolution remains controversial. On
the one hand, scans for positive selection have identified hundreds of
candidate loci and the genome-wide patterns of polymorphism show signatures
consistent with frequent positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies
have argued that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most
apparent genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction of
neutral diversity by linked recurrent deleterious mutations, known as
background selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data from the 1,000
Genomes project (Abecasis et al. 2012) and detect signatures of pervasive
positive selection once we correct for the effects of background selection. We
show that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid
substitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near
functionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid
substitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should
not be generated by background selection, such as the presence of unusually
long and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency
spectrum. We use forward simulations to show that the observed signatures
require a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions in the vicinity of the
amino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of
positive selection correlate more strongly with the presence of regulatory
sequences, as predicted by ENCODE (Gerstein et al. 2012), than the positions of
amino acid substitutions. Our results establish that adaptation was frequent in
human evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson (King
and Wilson 1975) that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory
changes.

    <title>Predicting non-neutral missense mutations and their biochemical
  consequences using genome-scale homology modeling of human protein complexes</title>
    <summary>  Computational methods are needed to differentiate the small fraction of
missense mutations that contribute to disease by disrupting protein function
from neutral variants. We describe several complementary methods using
large-scale homology modeling of human protein complexes to detect non-neutral
mutations. Importantly, unlike sequence conservation-based methods, this
structure-based approach provides experimentally testable biochemical
mechanisms for mutations in disease. Specifically, we infer metal ion, small
molecule, protein-protein, and nucleic acid binding sites by homology and find
that disease-associated missense mutations are more prevalent in each class of
binding site than are neutral mutations. Importantly, our approach identifies
considerably more binding sites than those annotated in the RefSeq database.
Furthermore, an analysis of metal ion and protein-protein binding sites
predicted by machine learning shows a similar preponderance of
disease-associated mutations in these sites. We also derive a statistical score
for predicting how mutations affect metal ion binding and find many dbSNP
mutations that likely disrupt ion binding but were not previously considered
deleterious. We also cluster mutations in the protein structure to discover
putative functional regions. Finally, we develop a machine learning predictor
for detecting disease-associated missense mutations and show that it
outperforms two other prediction methods on an independent test set.

    <title>Gene and Gene-Set Analysis for Genome-Wide Association Studies</title>
    <summary>  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci at
very stringent levels of statistical significance across many different human
traits. However, it is now clear that very large samples (n~10^4-10^5) are
needed to find the majority of genetic variants underlying risk for most human
diseases. Therefore, the field has engaged itself in a race to increase study
sample sizes with some studies yielding very successful results but also
studies which provide little or no new insights. This project started early on
in this new wave of studies and I decided to use an alternative approach that
uses prior biological knowledge to improve both interpretation and power of
GWAS. The project aimed to a) implement and develop new gene-based methods to
derive gene-level statistics to use GWAS in well established system biology
tools; b) use of these gene-level statistics in networks and gene-set analyses
of GWAS data; c) mine GWAS of neuropsychiatric disorders using gene, gene-sets
and integrative biology analyses with gene-expression studies; and d) explore
the ability of these methods to improve the analysis GWAS on disease
sub-phenotypes which usually suffer of very small sample sizes.

    <title>The standing pool of genomic structural variation in a natural
  population of Mimulus guttatus</title>
    <summary>  Major unresolved questions in evolutionary genetics include determining the
contributions of different mutational sources to the total pool of genetic
variation in a species, and understanding how these different forms of genetic
variation interact with natural selection. Recent work has shown that
structural variants (insertions, deletions, inversions and transpositions) are
a major source of genetic variation, often out-numbering single nucleotide
variants in terms of total bases affected. Despite the near ubiquity of
structural variants, major questions about their interaction with natural
selection remain. For example, how does the allele frequency spectrum of
structural variants differ when compared to single nucleotide variants? How
often do structural variants affect genes, and what are the consequences? To
begin to address these questions, we have systematically identified and
characterized a large set submicroscopic insertion and deletion (indel)
variants (between 1 kb to 200 kb in length) among ten individuals from a single
natural population of the plant species Mimulus guttatus. After extensive
computational filtering, we focused on a set of 4,142 high-confidence indels
that showed an experimental validation rate of 73%. All but one of these indels
were &lt; 200 kb. While the largest were generally at lower frequencies in the
population, a surprising number of large indels are at intermediate
frequencies. While indels overlapping with genes were much rarer than expected
by chance, nearly 600 genes were affected by an indel. NBS-LRR defense response
genes were the most enriched among the gene families affected. Most indels
associated with genes were rare and appeared to be under purifying selection,
though we do find four high-frequency derived insertion alleles that show
signatures of recent positive selection.

    <title>Improving genetic risk prediction by leveraging pleiotropy</title>
    <summary>  An important task of human genetics studies is to accurately predict disease
risks in individuals based on genetic markers, which allows for identifying
individuals at high disease risks, and facilitating their disease treatment and
prevention. Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
been conducted on many complex human traits in recent years, there has been
only limited success in translating these GWAS data into clinically useful risk
prediction models. The predictive capability of GWAS data is largely
bottlenecked by the available training sample size due to the presence of
numerous variants carrying only small to modest effects. Recent studies have
shown that different human traits may share common genetic bases. Therefore, an
attractive strategy to increase the training sample size and hence improve the
prediction accuracy is to integrate data of genetically correlated phenotypes.
Yet the utility of genetic correlation in risk prediction has not been explored
in the literature. In this paper, we analyzed GWAS data for bipolar and related
disorders (BARD) and schizophrenia (SZ) with a bivariate ridge regression
method, and found that jointly predicting the two phenotypes could
substantially increase prediction accuracy as measured by the AUC (area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve). We also found similar prediction
accuracy improvements when we jointly analyzed GWAS data for Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The empirical observations were substantiated
through our comprehensive simulation studies, suggesting that a gain in
prediction accuracy can be obtained by combining phenotypes with relatively
high genetic correlations. Through both real data and simulation studies, we
demonstrated pleiotropy as a valuable asset that opens up a new opportunity to
improve genetic risk prediction in the future.

    <title>Sailfish: Alignment-free Isoform Quantification from RNA-seq Reads using
  Lightweight Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  RNA-seq has rapidly become the de facto technique to measure gene expression.
However, the time required for analysis has not kept up with the pace of data
generation. Here we introduce Sailfish, a novel computational method for
quantifying the abundance of previously annotated RNA isoforms from RNA-seq
data. Sailfish entirely avoids mapping reads, which is a time-consuming step in
all current methods. Sailfish provides quantification estimates much faster
than existing approaches (typically 20-times faster) without loss of accuracy.

    <title>SInC: An accurate and fast error-model based simulator for SNPs, Indels
  and CNVs coupled with a read generator for short-read sequence data</title>
    <summary>  We report SInC (SNV, Indel and CNV) simulator and read generator, an
open-source tool capable of simulating biological variants taking into account
a platform-specific error model. SInC is capable of simulating and generating
single- and paired-end reads with user-defined insert size with high efficiency
compared to the other existing tools. SInC, due to its multi-threaded
capability during read generation, has a low time footprint. SInC is currently
optimised to work in limited infrastructure setup and can efficiently exploit
the commonly used quad-core desktop architecture to simulate short sequence
reads with deep coverage for large genomes. Sinc can be downloaded from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sincsimulator/.

    <title>Astrogenomics: big data, old problems, old solutions?</title>
    <summary>  The ominous warnings of a `data deluge' in the life sciences from
high-throughput DNA sequencing data are being supplanted by a second deluge, of
cliches bemoaning our collective scientific fate unless we address the genomic
data `tsunami'. It is imperative that we explore the many facets of the genome,
not just sequence but also transcriptional and epigenetic variability,
integrating these observations in order to attain a genuine understanding of
how genes function, towards a goal of genomics-based personalized medicine.
Determining any individual's genomic properties requires comparison to many
others, sifting out the specific from the trends, requiring access to the many
in order to yield information relevant to the few. This is the central big data
challenge in genomics that still requires some sort of resolution. Is there a
practical, feasible way of directly connecting the scientific community to this
data universe? The best answer could be in the stars overhead.

    <title>The influence of relatives on the efficiency and error rate of familial
  searching</title>
    <summary>  We investigate the consequences of adopting the criteria used by the state of
California, as described by Myers et al. (2011), for conducting familial
searches. We carried out a simulation study of randomly generated profiles of
related and unrelated individuals with 13-locus CODIS genotypes and YFiler
Y-chromosome haplotypes, on which the Myers protocol for relative
identification was carried out. For Y-chromosome sharing first degree
relatives, the Myers protocol has a high probability (80 - 99%) of identifying
their relationship. For unrelated individuals, there is a low probability that
an unrelated person in the database will be identified as a first-degree
relative. For more distant Y-haplotype sharing relatives (half-siblings, first
cousins, half-first cousins or second cousins) there is a substantial
probability that the more distant relative will be incorrectly identified as a
first-degree relative. For example, there is a 3 - 18% probability that a first
cousin will be identified as a full sibling, with the probability depending on
the population background. Although the California familial search policy is
likely to identify a first degree relative if his profile is in the database,
and it poses little risk of falsely identifying an unrelated individual in a
database as a first-degree relative, there is a substantial risk of falsely
identifying a more distant Y-haplotype sharing relative in the database as a
first-degree relative, with the consequence that their immediate family may
become the target for further investigation. This risk falls disproportionately
on those ethnic groups that are currently overrepresented in state and federal
databases.

    <title>Realistic simulations reveal extensive sample-specificity of RNA-seq
  biases</title>
    <summary>  In line with the importance of RNA-seq, the bioinformatics community has
produced numerous data analysis tools incorporating methods to correct
sample-specific biases. However, few advanced simulation tools exist to enable
benchmarking of competing correction methods. We introduce the first framework
to reproduce the properties of individual RNA-seq runs and, by applying it on
several datasets, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for
sample-specificity in realistic simulations.

    <title>Predicting genome-wide DNA methylation using methylation marks, genomic
  position, and DNA regulatory elements</title>
    <summary>  Background: Recent assays for individual-specific genome-wide DNA methylation
profiles have enabled epigenome-wide association studies to identify specific
CpG sites associated with a phenotype. Computational prediction of CpG
site-specific methylation levels is important, but current approaches tackle
average methylation within a genomic locus and are often limited to specific
genomic regions. Results: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns,
and show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions
solely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest
classifier to predict CpG site methylation levels using as features neighboring
CpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, and co-localization with
coding regions, CGIs, and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project, among
others. Our approach achieves 91% -- 94% prediction accuracy of genome-wide
methylation levels at single CpG site precision. The accuracy increases to 98%
when restricted to CpG sites within CGIs. Our classifier outperforms
state-of-the-art methylation classifiers and identifies features that
contribute to prediction accuracy: neighboring CpG site methylation status, CpG
island status, co-localized DNase I hypersensitive sites, and specific
transcription factor binding sites were found to be most predictive of
methylation levels. Conclusions: Our observations of DNA methylation patterns
led us to develop a classifier to predict site-specific methylation levels that
achieves the best DNA methylation predictive accuracy to date. Furthermore, our
method identified genomic features that interact with DNA methylation,
elucidating mechanisms involved in DNA methylation modification and regulation,
and linking different epigenetic processes.

    <title>SOAPdenovo-Trans: De novo transcriptome assembly with short RNA-Seq
  reads</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Transcriptome sequencing has long been the favored method for
quickly and inexpensively obtaining the sequences for a large number of genes
from an organism with no reference genome. With the rapidly increasing
throughputs and decreasing costs of next generation sequencing, RNA-Seq has
gained in popularity; but given the typically short reads (e.g. 2 x 90 bp
paired ends) of this technol- ogy, de novo assembly to recover complete or
full-length transcript sequences remains an algorithmic challenge. Results: We
present SOAPdenovo-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed
specifically for RNA-Seq. Its performance was evaluated on transcriptome
datasets from rice and mouse. Using the known transcripts from these
well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago) as our benchmark, we assessed
how SOAPdenovo- Trans and two other popular software handle the practical
issues of alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion
is that SOAPdenovo-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy, and
faster execution. Availability and Implementation: Source code and user manual

    <title>Estimation of genomic characteristics by analyzing k-mer frequency in de
  novo genome projects</title>
    <summary>  Background: With the fast development of next generation sequencing
technologies, increasing numbers of genomes are being de novo sequenced and
assembled. However, most are in fragmental and incomplete draft status, and
thus it is often difficult to know the accurate genome size and repeat content.
Furthermore, many genomes are highly repetitive or heterozygous, posing
problems to current assemblers utilizing short reads. Therefore, it is
necessary to develop efficient assembly-independent methods for accurate
estimation of these genomic characteristics. Results: Here we present a
framework for modeling the distribution of k-mer frequency from sequencing data
and estimating the genomic characteristics such as genome size, repeat
structure and heterozygous rate. By introducing novel techniques of k-mer
individuals, float precision estimation, and proper treatment of sequencing
error and coverage bias, the estimation accuracy of our method is significantly
improved over existing methods. We also studied how the various genomic and
sequencing characteristics affect the estimation accuracy using simulated
sequencing data, and discussed the limitations on applying our method to real
sequencing data. Conclusion: Based on this research, we show that the k-mer
frequency analysis can be used as a general and assembly-independent method for
estimating genomic characteristics, which can improve our understanding of a
species genome, help design the sequencing strategy of genome projects, and
guide the development of assembly algorithms. The programs developed in this

    <title>MicroRNAs Implicated in Dysregulation of Gene Expression Following Human
  Lung Transplantation</title>
    <summary>  Lung transplantation remains the only viable treatment option for the
majority of patients with advanced lung diseases. However, 5-year
post-transplant survival rates remain low primarily secondary to chronic
rejection. Novel insights from global gene expression profiles may provide
molecular phenotypes and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes after lung
transplantation. We showed the presence of a significant number of dysregulated
genes, particularly those genes involved in pathways and biological processes
such as immune response and defense, in the PBMCs derived from a cohort of
patients after lung transplantation. The contribution of miRNAs in regulating
these differential genes was also demonstrated.

    <title>Cell-cycle regulated transcription associates with DNA replication
  timing in yeast and human</title>
    <summary>  Eukaryotic DNA replication follows a specific temporal program, with some
genomic regions consistently replicating earlier than others, yet what
determines this program is largely unknown. Highly transcribed regions have
been observed to replicate in early S-phase in all plant and animal species
studied to date, but this relationship is thought to be absent from both
budding yeast and fission yeast. No association between cell-cycle regulated
transcription and replication timing has been reported for any species. Here I
show that in budding yeast, fission yeast, and human, the genes most highly
transcribed during S-phase replicate early, whereas those repressed in S-phase
replicate late. Transcription during other cell-cycle phases shows either the
opposite correlation with replication timing, or no relation. The relationship
is strongest near late-firing origins of replication, which is not consistent
with a previously proposed model -- that replication timing may affect
transcription -- and instead suggests a potential mechanism involving the
recruitment of limiting replication initiation factors during S-phase. These
results suggest that S-phase transcription may be an important determinant of
DNA replication timing across eukaryotes, which may explain the
well-established association between transcription and replication timing.

    <title>Revealing the missing heritability via cross-validated genome-wide
  association studies</title>
    <summary>  Presented here is a simple method for cross-validated genome-wide association
studies (cvGWAS). Focusing on phenotype prediction, the method is able to
reveal a significant amount of missing heritability by properly selecting a
small number of loci with implicit predictive ability. The results provide new
insights into the missing heritability problem and the underlying genetic
architecture of complex traits.

    <title>The molecular mechanism of a cis-regulatory adaptation in yeast</title>
    <summary>  Despite recent advances in our ability to detect adaptive evolution involving
the cis-regulation of gene expression, our knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms underlying these adaptations has lagged far behind. Across all model
organisms the causal mutations have been discovered for only a handful of gene
expression adaptations, and even for these, mechanistic details (e.g. the
trans-regulatory factors involved) have not been determined. We previously
reported a polygenic gene expression adaptation involving down-regulation of
the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of a cis-acting
mutation affecting a member of this pathway, ERG28. We show that the causal
mutation is a two-base deletion in the promoter of ERG28 that strongly reduces
the binding of two transcription factors, Sok2 and Mot3, thus abolishing their
regulation of ERG28. This down-regulation increases resistance to a widely used
antifungal drug targeting ergosterol, similar to mutations disrupting this
pathway in clinical yeast isolates. The identification of the causal genetic
variant revealed that the selection likely occurred after the deletion was
already present at high frequency in the population, rather than when it was a
new mutation. These results provide a detailed view of the molecular mechanism
of a cis-regulatory adaptation, and underscore the importance of this view to
our understanding of evolution at the molecular level.

    <title>A novel test for selection on cis-regulatory elements reveals positive
  and negative selection acting on mammalian transcriptional enhancers</title>
    <summary>  Measuring natural selection on genomic elements involved in the
cis-regulation of gene expression -- such as transcriptional enhancers and
promoters -- is critical for understanding the evolution of genomes, yet it
remains a major challenge. Many studies have attempted to detect positive or
negative selection in these noncoding elements by searching for those with the
fastest or slowest rates of evolution, but this can be problematic. Here we
introduce a new approach to this issue, and demonstrate its utility on three
mammalian transcriptional enhancers. Using results from saturation mutagenesis
studies of these enhancers, we classified all possible point mutations as
up-regulating, down-regulating, or silent, and determined which of these
mutations have occurred on each branch of a phylogeny. Applying a framework
analogous to Ka/Ks in protein-coding genes, we measured the strength of
selection on up-regulating and down-regulating mutations, in specific branches
as well as entire phylogenies. We discovered distinct modes of selection acting
on different enhancers: while all three have experienced negative selection
against down-regulating mutations, the selection pressures on up-regulating
mutations vary. In one case we detected positive selection for up-regulation,
while the other two had no detectable selection on up-regulating mutations. Our
methodology is applicable to the growing number of saturation mutagenesis data
sets, and provides a detailed picture of the mode and strength of natural
selection acting on cis-regulatory elements.

    <title>PCR-based isolation of multigene families: Lessons from the avian MHC
  class IIB</title>
    <summary>  The amount of sequence data available today highly facilitates the access to
genes from many gene families. Universal primers amplifying the desired genes
over a range of species are readily obtained by aligning conserved gene
regions, and laborious gene isolation procedures can often be replaced by
quicker PCR-based approaches. However, in case of multigene families, PCR-based
approaches bear the risk of incomplete isolation of family members. This
problem is most prominent in gene families with highly variable and thus
unpredictable number of gene copies among species, such as in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the present study we (i) report new
primers for the isolation of the MHC class IIB (MHCIIB) gene family in birds,
and (ii) share our experience with isolating MHCIIB genes from an unprecedented
number of avian species from all over the avian phylogeny. We report important
and usually underappreciated problems encountered during PCR-based multigene
family isolation, and provide a collection of measures that may help to
significantly improve the chance of successfully isolating complete multigene
families using PCR-based approaches.

    <title>SlopMap: a software application tool for quick and flexible
  identification of similar sequences using exact k-mer matching</title>
    <summary>  With the advent of Next-Generation (NG) sequencing, it has become possible to
sequence an entire genome quickly and inexpensively. However, in some
experiments one only needs to extract and assembly a portion of the sequence
reads, for example when performing transcriptome studies, sequencing
mitochondrial genomes, or characterizing exomes. With the raw DNA-library of a
complete genome it would appear to be a trivial problem to identify reads of
interest. But it is not always easy to incorporate well-known tools such as
BLAST, BLAT, Bowtie, and SOAP directly into a bioinformatics pipelines before
the assembly stage, either due to in- compatibility with the assembler's file
inputs, or because it is desirable to incorporate information that must be
extracted separately. For example, in order to incorporate flowgrams from a
Roche 454 sequencer into the Newbler assembler it is necessary to first extract
them from the original SFF files. We present SlopMap, a bioinformatics software
utility which allows rapid identification similar to provided target sequences
from either Roche 454 or Illumnia DNA library. With a simple and intuitive
command- line interface along with file output formats compatible with assembly
programs, SlopMap can be directly embedded in biological data processing
pipeline without any additional programming work. In addition, SlopMap
preserves flowgram information needed for Roche 454 assembler.

    <title>Maximum likelihood evidence for Neandertal admixture in Eurasian
  populations from three genomes</title>
    <summary>  Although there has been much interest in estimating divergence and admixture
from genomic data, it has proven difficult to distinguish gene flow after
divergence from alternative histories involving structure in the ancestral
population. The lack of a formal test to distinguish these scenarios has
sparked recent controversy about the possibility of interbreeding between
Neandertals and modern humans in Eurasia. We derive the probability of
mutational configurations in non-recombining sequence blocks under alternative
histories of divergence with admixture and ancestral structure. Dividing the
genome into short blocks makes it possible to compute maximum likelihood
estimates of parameters under both models. We apply this method to triplets of
human Neandertal genomes and quantify the relative support for models of
long-term population structure in the ancestral African popuation and admixture
from Neandertals into Eurasian populations after their expansion out of Africa.
Our analysis allows us -- for the first time -- to formally reject a history of
ancestral population structure and instead reveals strong support for admixture
from Neandertals into Eurasian populations at a higher rate (3.4%-7.9%) than
suggested previously.

    <title>Exploring Genome Characteristics and Sequence Quality Without a
  Reference</title>
    <summary>  The de novo assembly of large, complex genomes is a significant challenge
with currently available DNA sequencing technology. While many de novo assembly
software packages are available, comparatively little attention has been paid
to assisting the user with the assembly. This paper addresses the practical
aspects of de novo assembly by introducing new ways to perform quality
assessment on a collection of DNA sequence reads. The software implementation
calculates per-base error rates, paired-end fragment size histograms and
coverage metrics in the absence of a reference genome. Additionally, the
software will estimate characteristics of the sequenced genome, such as repeat
content and heterozygosity, that are key determinants of assembly difficulty.

    <title>Sibelia: A scalable and comprehensive synteny block generation tool for
  closely related microbial genomes</title>
    <summary>  Comparing strains within the same microbial species has proven effective in
the identification of genes and genomic regions responsible for virulence, as
well as in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. In this paper,
we present Sibelia, a tool for finding synteny blocks in multiple closely
related microbial genomes using iterative de Bruijn graphs. Unlike most other
tools, Sibelia can find synteny blocks that are repeated within genomes as well
as blocks shared by multiple genomes. It represents synteny blocks in a
hierarchy structure with multiple layers, each of which representing a
different granularity level. Sibelia has been designed to work efficiently with
a large number of microbial genomes; it finds synteny blocks in 31 S. aureus
genomes within 31 minutes and in 59 E.coli genomes within 107 minutes on a
standard desktop. Sibelia software is distributed under the GNU GPL v2 license
and is available at: https://github.com/bioinf/Sibelia Sibelia's web-server is

    <title>Cerulean: A hybrid assembly using high throughput short and long reads</title>
    <summary>  Genome assembly using high throughput data with short reads, arguably,
remains an unresolvable task in repetitive genomes, since when the length of a
repeat exceeds the read length, it becomes difficult to unambiguously connect
the flanking regions. The emergence of third generation sequencing (Pacific
Biosciences) with long reads enables the opportunity to resolve complicated
repeats that could not be resolved by the short read data. However, these long
reads have high error rate and it is an uphill task to assemble the genome
without using additional high quality short reads. Recently, Koren et al. 2012
proposed an approach to use high quality short reads data to correct these long
reads and, thus, make the assembly from long reads possible. However, due to
the large size of both dataset (short and long reads), error-correction of
these long reads requires excessively high computational resources, even on
small bacterial genomes. In this work, instead of error correction of long
reads, we first assemble the short reads and later map these long reads on the
assembly graph to resolve repeats.
  Contribution: We present a hybrid assembly approach that is both
computationally effective and produces high quality assemblies. Our algorithm
first operates with a simplified version of the assembly graph consisting only
of long contigs and gradually improves the assembly by adding smaller contigs
in each iteration. In contrast to the state-of-the-art long reads error
correction technique, which requires high computational resources and long
running time on a supercomputer even for bacterial genome datasets, our
software can produce comparable assembly using only a standard desktop in a
short running time.

    <title>Multiscale Identification of Topological Domains in Chromatin</title>
    <summary>  Recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have led to the discovery
of dense, contiguous, megabase-sized topological domains that are similar
across cell types and conserved across species. These domains are strongly
correlated with a number of chromatin markers and have since been included in a
number of analyses. However, functionally-relevant domains may exist at
multiple length scales. We introduce a new and efficient algorithm that is able
to capture persistent domains across various resolutions by adjusting a single
scale parameter. The identified novel domains are substantially different from
domains reported previously and are highly enriched for insulating factor CTCF
binding and histone modfications at the boundaries.

    <title>Probabilistic Approaches to Alignment with Tandem Repeats</title>
    <summary>  We propose a simple tractable pair hidden Markov model for pairwise sequence
alignment that accounts for the presence of short tandem repeats. Using the
framework of gain functions, we design several optimization criteria for
decoding this model and describe the resulting decoding algorithms, ranging
from the traditional Viterbi and posterior decoding to block-based decoding
algorithms specialized for our model. We compare the accuracy of individual
decoding algorithms on simulated data and find our approach superior to the
classical three-state pair HMM in simulations.

    <title>Accurate Decoding of Pooled Sequenced Data Using Compressed Sensing</title>
    <summary>  In order to overcome the limitations imposed by DNA barcoding when
multiplexing a large number of samples in the current generation of
high-throughput sequencing instruments, we have recently proposed a new
protocol that leverages advances in combinatorial pooling design (group
testing) doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003010. We have also demonstrated how this
new protocol would enable de novo selective sequencing and assembly of large,
highly-repetitive genomes. Here we address the problem of decoding pooled
sequenced data obtained from such a protocol. Our algorithm employs a
synergistic combination of ideas from compressed sensing and the decoding of
error-correcting codes. Experimental results on synthetic data for the rice
genome and real data for the barley genome show that our novel decoding
algorithm enables significantly higher quality assemblies than the previous
approach.

    <title>Protein (Multi-)Location Prediction: Using Location Inter-Dependencies
  in a Probabilistic Framework</title>
    <summary>  Knowing the location of a protein within the cell is important for
understanding its function, role in biological processes, and potential use as
a drug target. Much progress has been made in developing computational methods
that predict single locations for proteins, assuming that proteins localize to
a single location. However, it has been shown that proteins localize to
multiple locations. While a few recent systems have attempted to predict
multiple locations of proteins, they typically treat locations as independent
or capture inter-dependencies by treating each locations-combination present in
the training set as an individual location-class. We present a new method and a
preliminary system we have developed that directly incorporates
inter-dependencies among locations into the multiple-location-prediction
process, using a collection of Bayesian network classifiers. We evaluate our
system on a dataset of single- and multi-localized proteins. Our results,
obtained by incorporating inter-dependencies are significantly higher than
those obtained by classifiers that do not use inter-dependencies. The
performance of our system on multi-localized proteins is comparable to a top
performing system (YLoc+), without restricting predictions to be based only on
location-combinations present in the training set.

    <title>Comprehensive analysis of imprinted genes in maize reveals limited
  conservation with other species and allelic variation for imprinting</title>
    <summary>  In plants, a subset of genes exhibit imprinting in endosperm tissue such that
expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. Imprinting may
arise as a consequence of mechanisms for silencing of transposons during
reproduction, and in some cases imprinted expression of particular genes may
provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species.
Separate mechanisms for the origin of imprinted expression patterns and
maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the
targets of imprinting in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of
RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes,
providing a comprehensive analysis of imprinting in maize that allows
evaluation of imprinting at more than 95% of endosperm-expressed genes. We find
that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects
in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on a subset of these genes
that had &gt;90% expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the
paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10% of
imprinted genes show evidence of allelic variation for imprinting. A comparison
of imprinting in maize and rice reveals that only 13% of genes with syntenic
orthologs in both species exhibit conserved imprinting. Genes that exhibit
conserved imprinting in maize relative to rice have elevated dN/dS ratios
compared to other imprinted genes, suggesting a history of more rapid
evolution. Together, these data suggest that imprinting only has functional
relevance at a subset of loci that currently exhibit imprinting in maize.

    <title>The genome of the medieval Black Death agent (extended abstract)</title>
    <summary>  The genome of a 650 year old Yersinia pestis bacteria, responsible for the
medieval Black Death, was recently sequenced and assembled into 2,105 contigs
from the main chromosome. According to the point mutation record, the medieval
bacteria could be an ancestor of most Yersinia pestis extant species, which
opens the way to reconstructing the organization of these contigs using a
comparative approach. We show that recent computational paleogenomics methods,
aiming at reconstructing the organization of ancestral genomes from the
comparison of extant genomes, can be used to correct, order and complete the
contig set of the Black Death agent genome, providing a full chromosome
sequence, at the nucleotide scale, of this ancient bacteria. This sequence
suggests that a burst of mobile elements insertions predated the Black Death,
leading to an exceptional genome plasticity and increase in rearrangement rate.

    <title>Wavelet-based genetic association analysis of functional phenotypes
  arising from high-throughput sequencing assays</title>
    <summary>  Understanding how genetic variants influence cellular-level processes is an
important step towards understanding how they influence important
organismal-level traits, or "phenotypes", including human disease
susceptibility. To this end scientists are undertaking large-scale genetic
association studies that aim to identify genetic variants associated with
molecular and cellular phenotypes, such as gene expression, transcription
factor binding, or chromatin accessibility. These studies use high-throughput
sequencing assays (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq) to obtain high-resolution
data on how the traits vary along the genome in each sample. However, typical
association analyses fail to exploit these high-resolution measurements,
instead aggregating the data at coarser resolutions, such as genes, or windows
of fixed length. Here we develop and apply statistical methods that better
exploit the high-resolution data. The key idea is to treat the sequence data as
measuring an underlying "function" that varies along the genome, and then,
building on wavelet-based methods for functional data analysis, test for
association between genetic variants and the underlying function. Applying
these methods to identify genetic variants associated with chromatin
accessibility (dsQTLs) we find that they identify substantially more
associations than a simpler window-based analysis, and in total we identify 772
novel dsQTLs not identified by the original analysis.

    <title>Inferring evolutionary histories of pathway regulation from
  transcriptional profiling data</title>
    <summary>  One of the outstanding challenges in comparative genomics is to interpret the
evolutionary importance of regulatory variation between species. Rigorous
molecular evolution-based methods to infer evidence for natural selection from
expression data are at a premium in the field, and to date, phylogenetic
approaches have not been well-suited to address the question in the small sets
of taxa profiled in standard surveys of gene expression. We have developed a
strategy to infer evolutionary histories from expression profiles by analyzing
suites of genes of common function. In a manner conceptually similar to
molecular evolution models in which the evolutionary rates of DNA sequence at
multiple loci follow a gamma distribution, we modeled expression of the genes
of an \emph{a priori}-defined pathway with rates drawn from an inverse gamma
distribution. We then developed a fitting strategy to infer the parameters of
this distribution from expression measurements, and to identify gene groups
whose expression patterns were consistent with evolutionary constraint or rapid
evolution in particular species. Simulations confirmed the power and accuracy
of our inference method. As an experimental testbed for our approach, we
generated and analyzed transcriptional profiles of four \emph{Saccharomyces}
yeasts. The results revealed pathways with signatures of constrained and
accelerated regulatory evolution in individual yeasts and across the phylogeny,
highlighting the prevalence of pathway-level expression change during the
divergence of yeast species. We anticipate that our pathway-based phylogenetic
approach will be of broad utility in the search to understand the evolutionary
relevance of regulatory change.

relative to the autosomes. For example, the hemizgosity of the X may lead to a
lower chromosomal effective population size compared to the autosomes
suggesting that the X might be more strongly affected by genetic drift.
However, the X may also experience stronger positive selection than the
autosomes because recessive beneficial mutations will be more visible to
selection on the X where they will spend less time being masked by the
dominant, less beneficial allele - a proposal known as the faster-X hypothesis.
Thus, empirical studies demonstrating increased genetic divergence on the X
chromosome could be indicative of either adaptive or non-adaptive evolution. We
measured gene expression in Drosophila species and in D. melanogaster inbred
strains for both embryos and adults. In the embryos we found that expression
divergence is on average more than 20% higher for genes on the X chromosome
relative to the autosomes, but in contrast, in the inbred strains gene
expression variation is significantly lower on the X chromosome. Furthermore,
expression divergence of genes on Muller's D element is significantly greater
along the branch leading to the obscura sub-group, in which this element
segregates as a neo-X chromosome. In the adults, divergence is greatest on the
X chromosome for males, but not for females, yet in both sexes inbred strains
harbour the lowest level of gene expression variation on the X chromosome. We
consider different explanations for our results and conclude that they are most
consistent within the framework of the faster-X hypothesis.

    <title>Genetics of single-cell protein abundance variation in large yeast
  populations</title>
    <summary>  Many DNA sequence variants influence phenotypes by altering gene expression.
Our understanding of these variants is limited by sample sizes of current
studies and by measurements of mRNA rather than protein abundance. We developed
a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein
expression in very large populations of the yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae. The
method measures single-cell protein abundance through the use of
green-fluorescent-protein tags. We applied this method to 160 genes and
detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer
correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that
influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci cluster at hotspot
locations that influence multiple proteins - in some cases, more than half of
those examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects
on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in
cell physiology between yeast strains.

    <title>Agalma: an automated phylogenomics workflow</title>
    <summary>  In the past decade, transcriptome data have become an important component of
many phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic studies now regularly include genes
from newly sequenced transcriptomes, as well as publicly available
transcriptomes and genomes. Implementing such a phylogenomic study, however, is
computationally intensive, requires the coordinated use of many complex
software tools, and includes multiple steps for which no published tools exist.
Phylogenomic studies have therefore been manual or semiautomated. In addition
to taking considerable user time, this makes phylogenomic analyses difficult to
reproduce, compare, and extend. In addition, methodological improvements made
in the context of one study often cannot be easily applied and evaluated in the
context of other studies. We present Agalma, an automated tool that conducts
phylogenomic analyses. The user provides raw Illumina transcriptome data, and
Agalma produces annotated assemblies, aligned gene sequence matrices, a
preliminary phylogeny, and detailed diagnostics that allow the investigator to
make extensive assessments of intermediate analysis steps and the final
results. Sequences from other sources, such as externally assembled genomes and
transcriptomes, can also be incorporated in the analyses. Agalma tracks
provenance, profiles processor and memory use, records diagnostics, manages
metadata, and enables rich HTML reports for all stages of the analysis. Agalma
includes a test data set and a built-in test analysis of these data. In
addition to describing Agalma, we here present a sample analysis of a larger
seven-taxon data set. Agalma is available for download at
https://bitbucket.org/caseywdunn/agalma. Agalma allows complex phylogenomic
analyses to be implemented and described unambiguously as a series of
high-level commands. This will enable phylogenomic studies to be readily
reproduced, modified, and extended.

    <title>Synteny in Bacterial Genomes: Inference, Organization and Evolution</title>
    <summary>  Genes are not located randomly along genomes. Synteny, the conservation of
their relative positions in genomes of different species, reflects fundamental
constraints on natural evolution. We present approaches to infer pairs of
co-localized genes from multiple genomes, describe their organization, and
study their evolutionary history. In bacterial genomes, we thus identify
synteny units, or "syntons", which are clusters of proximal genes that
encompass and extend operons. The size distribution of these syntons divide
them into large syntons, which correspond to fundamental macro-molecular
complexes of bacteria, and smaller ones, which display a remarkable exponential
distribution of sizes. This distribution is "universal" in two respects: it
holds for vastly different genomes, and for functionally distinct genes.
Similar statistical laws have been reported previously in studies of bacterial
genomes, and generally attributed to purifying selection or neutral processes.
Here, we perform a new analysis based on the concept of parsimony, and find
that the prevailing evolutionary mechanism behind the formation of small
syntons is a selective process of gene aggregation. Altogether, our results
imply a common evolutionary process that selectively shapes the organization
and diversity of bacterial genomes.

    <title>Methods for scoring the collective effect of SNPs: Minor alleles of
  common SNPs quantitatively affect traits/diseases and are under both positive
  and negative selection</title>
    <summary>  Most common SNPs are popularly assumed to be neutral. We here developed novel
methods to examine in animal models and humans whether extreme amount of minor
alleles (MAs) carried by an individual may represent extreme trait values and
common diseases. We analyzed panels of genetic reference populations and
identified the MAs in each panel and the MA content (MAC) that each strain
carried. We also analyzed 21 published GWAS datasets of human diseases and
identified the MAC of each case or control. MAC was nearly linearly linked to
quantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life
span, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and
anti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and
strong immunity. Similarly, in Europeans or European Americans, enrichment of
MAs of fast but not slow evolutionary rate was linked to autoimmune and
numerous other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease,
psychiatric disorders, alcohol and cocaine addictions, cancer, and less life
span. Therefore, both high and low MAC correlated with extreme values in many
traits, indicating stabilizing selection on most MAs. The methods here are
broadly applicable and may help solve the missing heritability problem in
complex traits and diseases.

    <title>Map of Life: Measuring and Visualizing Species' Relatedness with
  "Molecular Distance Maps"</title>
    <summary>  We propose a novel combination of methods that (i) portrays quantitative
characteristics of a DNA sequence as an image, (ii) computes distances between
these images, and (iii) uses these distances to output a map wherein each
sequence is a point in a common Euclidean space. In the resulting "Molecular
Distance Map" each point signifies a DNA sequence, and the geometric distance
between any two points reflects the degree of relatedness between the
corresponding sequences and species.
  Molecular Distance Maps present compelling visual representations of
relationships between species and could be used for taxonomic clarifications,
for species identification, and for studies of evolutionary history. One of the
advantages of this method is its general applicability since, as sequence
alignment is not required, the DNA sequences chosen for comparison can be
completely different regions in different genomes. In fact, this method can be
used to compare any two DNA sequences. For example, in our dataset of 3,176
mitochondrial DNA sequences, it correctly finds the mtDNA sequences most
closely related to that of the anatomically modern human (the Neanderthal, the
Denisovan, and the chimp), and it finds that the sequence most different from
it belongs to a cucumber. Furthermore, our method can be used to compare real
sequences to artificial, computer-generated, DNA sequences. For example, it is
used to determine that the distances between a Homo sapiens sapiens mtDNA and
artificial sequences of the same length and same trinucleotide frequencies can
be larger than the distance between the same human mtDNA and the mtDNA of a
fruit-fly.
  We demonstrate this method's promising potential for taxonomical
clarifications by applying it to a diverse variety of cases that have been
historically controversial, such as the genus Polypterus, the family Tarsiidae,
and the vast (super)kingdom Protista.

    <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach to Utilizing Protein Structure to Identify
  Non-Random Somatic Mutations</title>
    <summary>  Background: It is well known that the development of cancer is caused by the
accumulation of somatic mutations within the genome. For oncogenes
specifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of "driver"
mutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to
some recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and
their resulting tumors, a variety of methods have been developed to identify
potential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and
mutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power
to identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary
structure via a graph theoretical approach.
  Results: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino Acid
Clustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial
structure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins
that are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in
proteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods.
Specifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in
well known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory
to account for the tertiary structure, GraphPAC identifies clusters in DPP4,
NRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods. The R package is
available at: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GraphPAC.html
  Conclusion: GraphPAC provides an alternative to iPAC and an extension to
current methodology when identifying potential activating driver mutations by
utilizing a graph theoretic approach when considering protein tertiary
structure.

    <title>QuorUM: an error corrector for Illumina reads</title>
    <summary>  Motivation: Illumina Sequencing data can provide high coverage of a genome by
relatively short (100 bp150 bp) reads at a low cost. Our goal is to produce
trimmed and error-corrected reads to improve genome assemblies. Our error
correction procedure aims at producing a set of error-corrected reads (1)
minimizing the number of distinct false k-mers, i.e. that are not present in
the genome, in the set of reads and (2) maximizing the number that are true,
i.e. that are present in the genome. Because coverage of a genome by Illumina
reads varies greatly from point to point, we cannot simply eliminate k-mers
that occur rarely.
  Results: Our software, called QuorUM, provides reasonably accurate correction
and is suitable for large data sets (1 billion bases checked and corrected per
day per core).
  Availability: QuorUM is distributed as an independent software package and as
a module of the MaSuRCA assembly software. Both are available under the GPL
open source license at http://www.genome.umd.edu.

effect of genetic polymorphisms on transgenerational inheritance of yeast
segregants that were derived from a cross between a laboratory strain and a
wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each SNP analyzed, the parental
allele present in less than half of the segregants panel was called the minor
allele (MA). We found a nonrandom distribution of MAs in the segregants,
indicating natural selection. We compared segregants with high MA content (MAC)
relative to those with less and found a more dramatic shortening of the lag
phase length for the high MAC group in response to 14 days of ethanol training.
Also, the short lag phase as acquired and epigenetically memorized by ethanol
training was more dramatically lost after 7 days of recovery in ethanol free
medium for the high MAC group. Sodium chloride treatment produced similar
observations. Using public datasets, we found MAC linkage to mRNA expression of
hundreds of genes. Finally, we found preferential effect of MAC on traits with
high number of known additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These results
provide evidence for the slightly deleterious nature of most MAs and a lower
capacity to maintain inheritance of traits in individuals or cells with greater
MAC, which have implications for disease prevention and treatment and the
"missing heritability" problem in complex traits and diseases.

    <title>A combination of transcriptional and microRNA regulation improves the
  stability of the relative concentrations of target genes</title>
    <summary>  It is well known that, under suitable conditions, microRNAs are able to fine
tune the relative concentration of their targets to any desired value. We show
that this function is particularly effective when one of the targets is a
Transcription Factor (TF) which regulates the other targets. This combination
defines a new class of feed-forward loops (FFLs) in which the microRNA plays
the role of master regulator. Using both deterministic and stochastic equations
we show that these FFLs are indeed able not only to fine-tune the TF/target
ratio to any desired value as a function of the miRNA concentration but also,
thanks to the peculiar topology of the circuit, to ensures the stability of
this ratio against stochastic fluctuations. These two effects are due to the
interplay between the direct transcriptional regulation and the indirect
TF/Target interaction due to competition of TF and target for miRNA binding
(the so called "sponge effect"). We then perform a genome wide search of these
FFLs in the human regulatory network and show that they are characterizedby a
very peculiar enrichment pattern. In particular they are strongly enriched in
all the situations in which the TF and its target have to be precisely kept at
the same concentration notwithstanding the environmental noise. As an example
we discuss the FFL involving E2F1 as Transcription Factor, RB1 as target and
miR-17 family as master regulator. These FFLs ensure a tight control of the
E2F/RB ratio which in turns ensures the stability of the transition from the
G0/G1 to the S phase in quiescent cells.

    <title>Cloudbreak: Accurate and Scalable Genomic Structural Variation Detection
  in the Cloud with MapReduce</title>
    <summary>  The detection of genomic structural variations (SV) remains a difficult
challenge in analyzing sequencing data, and the growing size and number of
sequenced genomes have rendered SV detection a bona fide big data problem.
MapReduce is a proven, scalable solution for distributed computing on huge data
sets. We describe a conceptual framework for SV detection algorithms in
MapReduce based on computing local genomic features, and use it to develop a
deletion and insertion detection algorithm, Cloudbreak. On simulated and real
data sets, Cloudbreak achieves accuracy improvements over popular SV detection
algorithms, and genotypes variants from diploid samples. It provides
dramatically shorter runtimes and the ability to scale to big data volumes on
large compute clusters. Cloudbreak includes tools to set up and configure
MapReduce (Hadoop) clusters on cloud services, enabling on-demand cluster
computing. Our implementation and source code are available at
http://github.com/cwhelan/cloudbreak .

    <title>CruzDB: software for annotation of genomic intervals with UCSC
  genome-browser data</title>
    <summary>  The biological significance of genomic features is often context-dependent.
We present CruzDB, a fast and intuitive programmatic interface to the UCSC
genome browser that facilitates integrative analyses of diverse local and
remotely hosted datasets. We showcase the syntax of CruzDB using miRNA-binding
sites as examples, and further demonstrate its utility with 3 novel biological
discoveries. First, we find that while exons replicate early, introns tend to
replicate late, suggesting a complex replication pattern in gene regions.
Second, variants associated with cognitive functions map to lincRNA transcripts
of relevant function. Third, lamina-associated domains are highly enriched in
olfaction-related genes. CruzDB is available at

    <title>Systematic identification of gene families for use as markers for
  phylogenetic and phylogeny- driven ecological studies of bacteria and archaea
  and their major subgroups</title>
    <summary>  With the astonishing rate that the genomic and metagenomic sequence data sets
are accumulating, there are many reasons to constrain the data analyses. One
approach to such constrained analyses is to focus on select subsets of gene
families that are particularly well suited for the tasks at hand. Such gene
families have generally been referred to as marker genes. We are particularly
interested in identifying and using such marker genes for phylogenetic and
phylogeny-driven ecological studies of microbes and their communities. We
therefore refer to these as PhyEco (for phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology)
markers. The dual use of these PhyEco markers means that we needed to develop
and apply a set of somewhat novel criteria for identification of the best
candidates for such markers. The criteria we focused on included universality
across the taxa of interest, ability to be used to produce robust phylogenetic
trees that reflect as much as possible the evolution of the species from which
the genes come, and low variation in copy number across taxa. We describe here
an automated protocol for identifying potential PhyEco markers from a set of
complete genome sequences. The protocol combines rapid searching, clustering
and phylogenetic tree building algorithms to generate protein families that
meet the criteria listed above. We report here the identification of PhyEco
markers for different taxonomic levels including 40 for all bacteria and
archaea, 114 for all bacteria, and much more for some of the individual phyla
of bacteria. This new list of PhyEco markers should allow much more detailed
automated phylogenetic and phylogenetic ecology analyses of these groups than
possible previously.

    <title>A hierarchical network heuristic for solving the orientation problem in
  genome assembly</title>
    <summary>  In the past several years, the problem of genome assembly has received
considerable attention from both biologists and computer scientists. An
important component of current assembly methods is the scaffolding process.
This process involves building ordered and oriented linear collections of
contigs (continuous overlapping sequence reads) called scaffolds and relies on
the use of mate pair data. A mate pair is a set of two reads that are sequenced
from the ends of a single fragment of DNA, and therefore have opposite mutual
orientations. When two reads of a mate-pair are placed into two different
contigs, one can infer the mutual orientation of these contigs. While several
orientation algorithms exist as part of assembly programs, all encounter
challenges while solving the orientation problem due to errors from
mis-assemblies in contigs or errors in read placements. In this paper we
present an algorithm based on hierarchical clustering that independently solves
the orientation problem and is robust to errors. We show that our algorithm can
correctly solve the orientation problem for both faux (generated) assembly data
and real assembly data for {\em R. sphaeroides bacteria}. We demonstrate that
our algorithm is stable to both changes in the initial orientations as well as
noise in the data, making it advantageous compared to traditional approaches.

    <title>A new DNA alignment method based on inverted index</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a novel DNA sequences alignment method based on inverted
index. Now most large scale information retrieval system are all use inverted
index as the basic data structure. But its application in DNA sequence
alignment is still not found. This paper just discuss such applications. Three
main problems, DNA segmenting, long DNA query search, DNA search ranking
algorithm and evaluation method are detailed respectively. This research
presents a new avenue to build more effective DNA alignment methods.

    <title>Improving transcriptome assembly through error correction of
  high-throughput sequence reads</title>
    <summary>  The study of functional genomics--particularly in non-model organisms has
been dramatically improved over the last few years by use of transcriptomes and
RNAseq. While these studies are potentially extremely powerful, a
computationally intensive procedure--the de novo construction of a reference
transcriptome must be completed as a prerequisite to further analyses. The
accurate reference is critically important as all downstream steps, including
estimating transcript abundance are critically dependent on the construction of
an accurate reference. Though a substantial amount of research has been done on
assembly, only recently have the pre-assembly procedures been studied in
detail. Specifically, several stand-alone error correction modules have been
reported on, and while they have shown to be effective in reducing errors at
the level of sequencing reads, how error correction impacts assembly accuracy
is largely unknown. Here, we show via use of a simulated dataset, that applying
error correction to sequencing reads has significant positive effects on
assembly accuracy, by reducing assembly error by nearly 50%, and therefore
should be applied to all datasets.

    <title>Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead</title>
    <summary>  In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to
have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species.
In the presence of lateral gene transfer (LGT), however, this may not be the
case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have
gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or
reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the
evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modelling the
speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate
that if the number of sampled species is small compared to the total number of
existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve
speciation to, and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that
the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good
approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described
by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to
calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum likelihood
reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near
universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of
transfer events -- 28% -- appear to have topological signatures of evolution
along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their
ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

    <title>Lateral Gene Transfer, Rearrangement and Reconciliation</title>
    <summary>  Background.
  Models of ancestral gene order reconstruction have progressively integrated
different evolutionary patterns and processes such as unequal gene content,
gene duplications, and implicitly sequence evolution via reconciled gene trees.
In unicellular organisms, these models have so far ignored lateral gene
transfer, even though it can have an important confounding effect on such
models, as well as a rich source of information on the function of genes
through the detection of transfers of entire clusters of genes.
  Result.
  We report an algorithm together with its implementation, DeCoLT, that
reconstructs ancestral genome organization based on reconciled gene trees which
summarize information on sequence evolution, gene origination, duplication,
loss, and lateral transfer. DeCoLT finds in polynomial time the minimum number
of rearrangements, computed as the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies
between pairs of genes. We apply DeCoLT to 1099 gene families from 36
cyanobacteria genomes.
  Conclusion.
  DeCoLT is able to reconstruct adjacencies in 35 ancestral bacterial genomes
with a thousand genes families in a few hours, and detects clusters of
co-transferred genes. As there is no constraint on genome organization,
adjacencies can be generalized to any relationship between genes to reconstruct
ancestral interactions, functions or complexes with the same framework.

    <title>Assemblathon 2: evaluating de novo methods of genome assembly in three
  vertebrate species</title>
    <summary>  Background - The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues to
become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into
high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome
assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their
performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer
read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled
sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the
quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are
intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results
- In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for
three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total
of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these
assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and
several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key
measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions
- Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a
significant representation of their genes, regulatory sequences, and overall
genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries
suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome
assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one
species may not necessarily work well for another.

    <title>The complex hybrid origins of the root knot nematodes revealed through
  comparative genomics</title>
    <summary>  Meloidogyne root knot nematodes (RKN) can infect most of the world's
agricultural crop species and are among the most important of all plant
pathogens. As yet however we have little understanding of their origins or the
genomic basis of their extreme polyphagy. The most damaging pathogens reproduce
by mitotic parthenogenesis and are suggested to originate by interspecific
hybridizations between unknown parental taxa. We sequenced the genome of the
diploid meiotic parthenogen Meloidogyne floridensis, and use a comparative
genomic approach to test the hypothesis that it was involved in the hybrid
origin of the tropical mitotic parthenogen M. incognita. Phylogenomic analysis
of gene families from M. floridensis, M. incognita and an outgroup species M.
hapla was used to trace the evolutionary history of these species' genomes,
demonstrating that M. floridensis was one of the parental species in the hybrid
origins of M. incognita. Analysis of the M. floridensis genome revealed many
gene loci present in divergent copies, as they are in M. incognita, indicating
that it too had a hybrid origin. The triploid M. incognita is shown to be a
complex double-hybrid between M. floridensis and a third, unidentified parent.
The agriculturally important RKN have very complex origins involving the mixing
of several parental genomes by hybridization and their extreme polyphagy and
agricultural success may be related to this hybridization, producing
transgressive variation on which natural selection acts. Studying RKN variation
via individual marker loci may fail due to the species' convoluted origins, and
multi-species population genomics is essential to understand the hybrid
diversity and adaptive variation of this important species complex. This
comparative genomic analysis provides a compelling example of the importance
and complexity of hybridization in generating animal species diversity more
generally.

    <title>Bound to succeed: Transcription factor binding site prediction and its
  contribution to understanding virulence and environmental adaptation in
  bacterial plant pathogens</title>
    <summary>  Bacterial plant pathogens rely on a battalion of transcription factors to
fine-tune their response to changing environmental conditions and marshal the
genetic resources required for successful pathogenesis. Prediction of
transcription factor binding sites represents an important tool for elucidating
regulatory networks, and has been conducted in multiple genera of plant
pathogenic bacteria for the purpose of better understanding mechanisms of
survival and pathogenesis. The major categories of transcription factor binding
sites that have been characterized are reviewed here with emphasis on in silico
methods used for site identification and challenges therein, their
applicability to different types of sequence datasets, and insights into
mechanisms of virulence and survival that have been gained through binding site
mapping. An improved strategy for establishing E value cutoffs when using
existing models to screen uncharacterized genomes is also discussed.

    <title>TaSer (TabAnno and SeqMiner): a toolset for annotating and querying
  next-generation sequence data</title>
    <summary>  Summary: We develop TaSer (TabAnno and SeqMiner), a toolkit for annotating
and querying next generation sequence (NGS) dataset in tab-delimited files.
TabAnno is a powerful and efficient command-line tool designed to pre-process
sequence data, annotate variations and generate an indexed feature-enriched
project file that can integrate multiple sources of information. Using the
project file generated by TabAnno, complex queries to the sequence dataset can
be performed using SeqMiner, an R-package designed to efficiently access large
datasets. Extracted information can be conveniently viewed and analyzed by
tools in R. TaSer is optimized and computationally more efficient than software
using database systems. It enables annotating and querying NGS dataset using
moderate computing resource. Availability and implementation: TabAnno can be
downloaded from github (zhanxw.github.io/anno/). SeqMiner is distributed on
CRAN (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqminer). Contact: X.Z.

    <title>Segmenting DNA sequence into `words'</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a novel method to segment/decode DNA sequences based on
n-grams statistical language model. Firstly, we find the length of most DNA
'words' is 12 to 15 bps by analyzing the genomes of 12 model species. Then we
design an unsupervised probability based approach to segment the DNA sequences.
The benchmark of segmenting method is also proposed.

    <title>Low-bandwidth and non-compute intensive remote identification of
  microbes from raw sequencing reads</title>
    <summary>  Cheap high-throughput DNA sequencing may soon become routine not only for
human genomes but also for practically anything requiring the identification of
living organisms from their DNA: tracking of infectious agents, control of food
products, bioreactors, or environmental samples.
  We propose a novel general approach to the analysis of sequencing data in
which the reference genome does not have to be specified. Using a distributed
architecture we are able to query a remote server for hints about what the
reference might be, transferring a relatively small amount of data, and the
hints can be used for more computationally-demanding work.
  Our system consists of a server with known reference DNA indexed, and a
client with raw sequencing reads. The client sends a sample of unidentified
reads, and in return receives a list of matching references known to the
server. Sequences for the references can be retrieved and used for exhaustive
computation on the reads, such as alignment.
  To demonstrate this approach we have implemented a web server, indexing tens
of thousands of publicly available genomes and genomic regions from various
organisms and returning lists of matching hits from query sequencing reads. We
have also implemented two clients, one of them running in a web browser, in
order to demonstrate that gigabytes of raw sequencing reads of unknown origin
could be identified without the need to transfer a very large volume of data,
and on modestly powered computing devices.
  A web access is available at http://tapir.cbs.dtu.dk. The source code for a
python command-line client, a server, and supplementary data is available at
http://bit.ly/1aURxkc.

    <title>Complex Morlet Wavelet Analysis of the DNA Frequency Chaos Game Signal
  and Revealing Specific Motifs of Introns in C.elegans</title>
    <summary>  Nowadays, studying introns is becoming a very promising field in the
genomics. Even though they play a role in the dynamic regulation of gene and in
the organism's evolution, introns have not attracted enough attention like
exons did; especially of digital signal processing researchers. Thus, we focus
on analysis of the C.elegans introns. In this paper, we propose the complex
Morlet wavelet analysis to investigate introns' characterization in the
C.elegans genes. However, catching the change in frequency response with
respect to time of the gene sequences is hindered by their presence in the form
of strings of characters. This can only be counteracted by assigning numerical
values to each of the DNA characters. This operation defines the so called "DNA
coding approach". In this context, we propose a new coding technique based on
the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) that we name the "Frequency
Chaos Game Signal" (FCGS). Results of the complex Morlet wavelet Analysis
applied to the Celegans FCGS are showing a very distinguished texture. The
visual interpretation of the colour scalograms is proved to be an efficient
tool for revealing significant information about intronic sequences.

    <title>Count-based differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data
  using R and Bioconductor</title>
    <summary>  RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of
transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene
regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of
differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues,
perturbations), while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that
affect the data collection process. There are a number of subtle yet critical
aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of
biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of
statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature,
and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol
presents a "state-of-the-art" computational and statistical RNA-seq
differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source
R language and Bioconductor software and in particular, two widely-used tools
DESeq and edgeR. Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10
samples) can be &lt;1 hour, with computation time &lt;1 day using a standard desktop
PC.

    <title>Clusters of microRNAs emerge by new hairpins in existing transcripts</title>
    <summary>  Genetic linkage may result in the expression of multiple products from a
polycistronic transcript, under the control of a single promoter. In animals,
protein-coding polycistronic transcripts are rare. However, microRNAs are
frequently clustered in the genomes of animals, and these clusters are often
transcribed as a single unit. The evolution of microRNA clusters has been the
subject of much speculation, and a selective advantage of clusters of
functionally related microRNAs is often proposed. However, the origin of
microRNA clusters has not been so far explored. Here we study the evolution of
microRNA clusters in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that the majority of
microRNA clusters arose by the de novo formation of new microRNA-like hairpins
in existing microRNA transcripts. Some clusters also emerged by tandem
duplication of a single microRNA. Comparative genomics show that these clusters
are unlikely to split or undergo rearrangements. We did not find any instances
of clusters appearing by rearrangement of pre-existing microRNA genes. We
propose a model for microRNA cluster evolution in which selection over one of
the microRNAs in the cluster interferes with the evolution of the other linked
microRNAs. Our analysis suggests that the study of microRNAs and small RNAs
must consider linkage associations.

    <title>Differential meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from multiple studies</title>
    <summary>  High-throughput sequencing is now regularly used for studies of the
transcriptome (RNA-seq), particularly for comparisons among experimental
conditions. For the time being, a limited number of biological replicates are
typically considered in such experiments, leading to low detection power for
differential expression. As their cost continues to decrease, it is likely that
additional follow-up studies will be conducted to re-address the same
biological question. We demonstrate how p-value combination techniques
previously used for microarray meta-analyses can be used for the differential
analysis of RNA-seq data from multiple related studies. These techniques are
compared to a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) including a
fixed study effect on simulated data and real data on human melanoma cell
lines. The GLM with fixed study effect performed well for low inter-study
variation and small numbers of studies, but was outperformed by the
meta-analysis methods for moderate to large inter-study variability and larger
numbers of studies. To conclude, the p-value combination techniques illustrated
here are a valuable tool to perform differential meta-analyses of RNA-seq data
by appropriately accounting for biological and technical variability within
studies as well as additional study-specific effects. An R package metaRNASeq
is available on the R Forge.

    <title>Sashimi plots: Quantitative visualization of RNA sequencing read
  alignments</title>
    <summary>  We introduce Sashimi plots, a quantitative multi-sample visualization of mRNA
sequencing reads aligned to gene annotations. Sashimi plots are made using
alignments (stored in the SAM/BAM format) and gene model annotations (in GFF
format), which can be custom-made by the user or obtained from databases such
as Ensembl or UCSC. We describe two implementations of Sashimi plots: (1) a
stand-alone command line implementation aimed at making customizable
publication quality figures, and (2) an implementation built into the
Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) browser, which enables rapid and dynamic
creation of Sashimi plots for any genomic region of interest, suitable for
exploratory analysis of alternatively spliced regions of the transcriptome.
Isoform expression estimates outputted by the MISO program can be optionally
plotted along with Sashimi plots. Sashimi plots can be used to quickly screen
differentially spliced exons along genomic regions of interest and can be used
in publication quality figures. The Sashimi plot software and documentation is
available from: http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/miso/docs/sashimi.html

    <title>Dynamic Transcript Profiling of Candida Albicans Infection in Zebrafish:
  a Pathogen-Host Interaction Study</title>
    <summary>  Candida albicans is responsible for a number of life-threatening infections
and causes considerable morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients.
Previous studies of C. albicans pathogenesis have suggested several steps must
occur before virulent infection, including early adhesion, invasion, and late
tissue damage. However, the mechanism that triggers C. albicans transformation
from yeast to hyphae form during infection has yet to be fully elucidated. This
study used a systems biology approach to investigate C. albicans infection in
zebrafish. The surviving fish were sampled at different post-infection time
points to obtain time-lapsed, genome-wide transcriptomic data from both
organisms, which were accompanied with in sync histological analyses. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the dynamic gene expression
profiles of significant variations in both C. albicans and zebrafish. The
results categorized C. albicans infection into three progressing phases:
adhesion, invasion, and damage. Such findings were highly supported by the
corresponding histological analysis. Furthermore, the dynamic interspecies
transcript profiling revealed that C. albicans activated its filamentous
formation during invasion and the iron scavenging functions during the damage
phases, whereas zebrafish ceased its iron homeostasis function following
massive hemorrhage during the later stages of infection. This was followed by
massive hemorrhaging toward the end stage of infection. Most of the immune
related genes were expressed as the infection progressed from invasion to the
damage phase. Such global, inter-species evidence of virulence-immune and iron
competition dynamics during C. albicans infection could be crucial in
understanding control fungal pathogenesis.

    <title>mendelFix: a Perl script for checking Mendelian errors in high density
  SNP data of trio designs</title>
    <summary>  Here we present mendelFix, a Perl script for checking Mendelian errors in
genome-wide SNP data of trio designs. The program takes 12-recoded PLINK PED
and MAP files as input to calculate a series of summary statistics for
Mendelian errors, sets missing offspring genotypes that present Mendelian
inconsistencies, and implements a simplistic procedure to infer missing
genotypes using parent information. The program can be easily incorporated in

    <title>Efficient Exploration of the Space of Reconciled Gene Trees</title>
    <summary>  Gene trees record the combination of gene level events, such as duplication,
transfer and loss, and species level events, such as speciation and extinction.
Gene tree-species tree reconciliation methods model these processes by drawing
gene trees into the species tree using a series of gene and species level
events. The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always
involves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable
relationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species
tree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees the
space of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of
sequence evolution and gene tree-species tree reconciliation.
  Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic
approach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be
amalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of trees. We
implement ALE in the context of a reconciliation model, which allows for the
duplication, transfer and loss of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate
the sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled
gene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood.
  We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the
joint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using
sequence alone. Using realistic topologies, branch lengths and alignment sizes,
we demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of
sequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families
from 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference
results in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with 24%, 59%
and 46% percent reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers and
losses.

    <title>Modeling the dynamics of bivalent histone modifications</title>
    <summary>  Epigenetic modifications to histones may promote either activation or
repression of the transcription of nearby genes. Recent experimental studies
show that the promoters of many lineage-control genes in stem cells have
"bivalent domains" in which the nucleosomes contain both active (H3K4me3) and
repressive (H3K27me3) marks. It is generally agreed that bivalent domains play
an important role in stem cell differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. Here we formulate a mathematical model to investigate the
dynamic properties of histone modification patterns. We then illustrate that
our modeling framework can be used to capture key features of experimentally
observed combinatorial chromatin states.

    <title>SPATA: A Seeding and Patching Algorithm for Hybrid Transcriptome
  Assembly</title>
    <summary>  Transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq reads is an active area of bioinformatics
research. The ever-declining cost and the increasing depth of RNA-Seq have
provided unprecedented opportunities to better identify expressed transcripts.
However, the nonlinear transcript structures and the ultra-high throughput of
RNA-Seq reads pose significant algorithmic and computational challenges to the
existing transcriptome assembly approaches, either reference-guided or de novo.
While reference-guided approaches offer good sensitivity, they rely on
alignment results of the splice-aware aligners and are thus unsuitable for
species with incomplete reference genomes. In contrast, de novo approaches do
not depend on the reference genome but face a computational daunting task
derived from the complexity of the graph built for the whole transcriptome. In
response to these challenges, we present a hybrid approach to exploit an
incomplete reference genome without relying on splice-aware aligners. We have
designed a split-and-align procedure to efficiently localize the reads to
individual genomic loci, which is followed by an accurate de novo assembly to
assemble reads falling into each locus. Using extensive simulation data, we
demonstrate a high accuracy and precision in transcriptome reconstruction by
comparing to selected transcriptome assembly tools. Our method is implemented
in assemblySAM, a GUI software freely available at

    <title>biobambam: tools for read pair collation based algorithms on BAM files</title>
    <summary>  Sequence alignment data is often ordered by coordinate (id of the reference
sequence plus position on the sequence where the fragment was mapped) when
stored in BAM files, as this simplifies the extraction of variants between the
mapped data and the reference or of variants within the mapped data. In this
order paired reads are usually separated in the file, which complicates some
other applications like duplicate marking or conversion to the FastQ format
which require to access the full information of the pairs. In this paper we
introduce biobambam, an API for efficient BAM file reading supporting the
efficient collation of alignments by read name without performing a complete
resorting of the input file and some tools based on this API performing tasks
like marking duplicate reads and conversion to the FastQ format. In comparison
with previous approaches to problems involving the collation of alignments by
read name like the BAM to FastQ or duplication marking utilities in the Picard
suite the approach of biobambam can often perform an equivalent task more
efficiently in terms of the required main memory and run-time.

    <title>Genome Sequencing Highlights Genes Under Selection and the Dynamic Early
  History of Dogs</title>
    <summary>  To identify genetic changes underlying dog domestication and reconstruct
their early evolutionary history, we analyzed novel high-quality genome
sequences of three gray wolves, one from each of three putative centers of dog
domestication, two ancient dog lineages (Basenji and Dingo) and a golden jackal
as an outgroup. We find dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process
involving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene
flow, which confounds previous inferences of dog origins. In dogs, the
domestication bottleneck was severe involving a 17 to 49-fold reduction in
population size, a much stronger bottleneck than estimated previously from less
intensive sequencing efforts. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after
their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs
arose was far larger than represented by modern wolf populations. Conditional
on mutation rate, we narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog
domestication to an interval from 11 to 16 thousand years ago. This period
predates the rise of agriculture, implying that the earliest dogs arose
alongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic
origin of dogs, we find that surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages
from putative domestication centers are more closely related to dogs, and the
sampled wolves instead form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in
combination with our finding of dog-wolf admixture during the process of
domestication, suggests a re-evaluation of past hypotheses of dog origin is
necessary. Finally, we also detect signatures of selection, including evidence
for selection on genes implicated in morphology, metabolism, and neural
development. Uniquely, we find support for selective sweeps at regulatory sites
suggesting gene regulatory changes played a critical role in dog domestication.

    <title>Reconstructing the Population Genetic History of the Caribbean</title>
    <summary>  The Caribbean basin is home to some of the most complex interactions in
recent history among previously diverged human populations. Here, by making use
of genome-wide SNP array data, we characterize ancestral components of
Caribbean populations on a sub-continental level and unveil fine-scale patterns
of population structure distinguishing insular from mainland Caribbean
populations as well as from other Hispanic/Latino groups. We provide genetic
evidence for an inland South American origin of the Native American component
in island populations and for extensive pre-Columbian gene flow across the
Caribbean basin. The Caribbean-derived European component shows significant
differentiation from parental Iberian populations, presumably as a result of
founder effects during the colonization of the New World. Based on demographic
models, we reconstruct the complex population history of the Caribbean since
the onset of continental admixture. We find that insular populations are best
modeled as mixtures absorbing two pulses of African migrants, coinciding with
early and maximum activity stages of the transatlantic slave trade. These two
pulses appear to have originated in different regions within West Africa,
imprinting two distinguishable signatures in present day Afro-Caribbean genomes
and shedding light on the genetic impact of the dynamics occurring during the
slave trade in the Caribbean.

    <title>Genetic Complexity in a Drosophila Model of Diabetes-Associated
  Misfolded Human Proinsulin</title>
    <summary>  Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to create a genetic model of human
permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and present experimental results
describing dimensions of this complexity. The approach involves the transgenic
expression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, which is a
cause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC96Y causes a
reduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal
discs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In
the wing, expression of hINSC96Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and
mechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes
regulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are
sensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type)
proinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE1-mediated Xbp1
alternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response
activation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS
transgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic
Reference Panel produces F1 adults with a continuous range of disease
phenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of
mutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum
in these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of
two dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop
(Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue
specificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its
own distinct signature. The genetic dominance of disease-specific phenotypic
variability makes this approach amenable to genome-wide association study
(GWAS) in a simple F1 screen of natural variation.

    <title>Augmenting transcriptome assembly combinatorially</title>
    <summary>  RNA-seq allows detection and precise quantification of transcripts, provides
comprehensive understanding of exon/intron boundaries, aids discovery of
alternatively spliced isoforms and fusion transcripts along with measurement of
allele-specific expression. Researchers interested in studying and constructing
transcriptomes, especially for non-model species, often face the conundrum of
choosing from a number of available de novo and genome-guided assemblers. A
comprehensive comparative study is required to assess and evaluate their
efficiency and sensitivity for transcript assembly, reconstruction and
recovery. None of the popular assembly tools in use today achieves requisite
sensitivity, specificity or recovery of full-length transcripts on its own.
Hence, it is imperative that methods be developed in order to augment
assemblies generated from multiple tools, with minimal compounding of error.
Here, we present an approach to combinatorially augment transciptome assembly
based on a rigorous comparative study of popular de novo and genome-guided

    <title>Using R and Bioconductor for proteomics data analysis</title>
    <summary>  This review presents how R, the popular statistical environment and
programming language, can be used in the frame of proteomics data analysis. A
short introduction to R is given, with special emphasis on some of the features
that make R and its add-on packages a premium software for sound and
reproducible data analysis. The reader is also advised on how to find relevant
R software for proteomics. Several use cases are then presented, illustrating
data input/output, quality control, quantitative proteomics and data analysis.
Detailed code and additional links to extensive documentation are available in
the freely available companion package RforProteomics.

    <title>Effect of Genetic Variation in a Drosophila Model of Diabetes-Associated
  Misfolded Human Proinsulin</title>
    <summary>  The identification and validation of gene-gene interactions is a major
challenge in human studies. Here, we explore an approach for studying epistasis
in humans using a Drosophila melanogaster model of neonatal diabetes mellitus.
Expression of mutant preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, in the eye imaginal disc mimics
the human disease activating conserved cell stress response pathways leading to
cell death and reduction in eye area. Dominant-acting variants in wild-derived
inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel produce a continuous,
highly heritable, distribution of eye degeneration phenotypes. A genome-wide
association study (GWAS) in 154 sequenced lines identified 29 candidate SNPs in
16 loci with P &lt; 10-5 including one SNP in an intron of the gene sulfateless
(sfl) which exceeded a conservative genome-wide significance threshold of P =
0.05 level (-log10 P &gt; 7.62). RNAi knock-downs of sfl enhanced the eye
degeneration phenotype in a mutant-hINS-dependent manner. sfl encodes a protein
required for sulfation of the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate. Two
additional genes in the heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthetic pathway (tout velu,
ttv and brother of tout velu, botv) also modified the eye phenotype, suggesting
a link between HS-modified proteins and cellular responses to misfolded
proteins. Finally, intronic variants marking the QTL were associated with
decreased sfl expression, a result consistent with that predicted by RNAi
studies. The ability to create a model of human genetic disease in the fly, map
a QTL by GWAS to a specific gene (and noncoding variant), validate its
contribution to disease with available genetic resources, and experimentally
link the variant to a molecular mechanism, demonstrate the many advantages
Drosophila holds in determining the genetic underpinnings of human disease.

    <title>Integrating Prior Knowledge Into Prognostic Biomarker Discovery based on
  Network Structure</title>
    <summary>  Background: Predictive, stable and interpretable gene signatures are
generally seen as an important step towards a better personalized medicine.
During the last decade various methods have been proposed for that purpose.
However, one important obstacle for making gene signatures a standard tool in
clinics is the typical low reproducibility of these signatures combined with
the difficulty to achieve a clear biological interpretation. For that purpose
in the last years there has been a growing interest in approaches that try to
integrate information from molecular interaction networks. Results: We propose
a novel algorithm, called FrSVM, which integrates protein-protein interaction
network information into gene selection for prognostic biomarker discovery. Our
method is a simple filter based approach, which focuses on central genes with
large differences in their expression. Compared to several other competing
methods our algorithm reveals a significantly better prediction performance and
higher signature stability. More- over, obtained gene lists are highly enriched
with known disease genes and drug targets. We extendd our approach further by
integrating information on candidate disease genes and targets of disease
associated Transcript Factors (TFs).

    <title>Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with
  BWA-MEM</title>
    <summary>  Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or
long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It
automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports
paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to
sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp
to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better
performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
  Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of
BWA, which is available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa.

    <title>Virtual in situs: Sequencing mRNA from cryo-sliced Drosophila embryos to
  determine genome-wide spatial patterns of gene expression</title>
    <summary>  Complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression underlie embryo
differentiation, yet methods do not yet exist for the efficient genome-wide
determination of spatial expression patterns during development. In situ
imaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult
and time consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated.
Sequencing, in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to
homogenized tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. It is likely that
these methods will ultimately converge, and we will be able to sequence RNAs in
situ, simultaneously determining their identity and location. As a step along
this path, we developed methods to cryosection individual blastoderm stage
Drosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and sequence
the mRNA isolated from each 25 micron slice. The spatial patterns of gene
expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ
hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide
timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through
gastrulation. We identify numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not
yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects.
This simple experiment demonstrates the potential for combining careful
anatomical dissection with high-throughput sequencing to obtain spatially
resolved gene expression on a genome-wide scale.

    <title>Distilled Single Cell Genome Sequencing and De Novo Assembly for Sparse
  Microbial Communities</title>
    <summary>  Identification of every single genome present in a microbial sample is an
important and challenging task with crucial applications. It is challenging
because there are typically millions of cells in a microbial sample, the vast
majority of which elude cultivation. The most accurate method to date is
exhaustive single cell sequencing using multiple displacement amplification,
which is simply intractable for a large number of cells. However, there is hope
for breaking this barrier as the number of different cell types with distinct
genome sequences is usually much smaller than the number of cells.
  Here, we present a novel divide and conquer method to sequence and de novo
assemble all distinct genomes present in a microbial sample with a sequencing
cost and computational complexity proportional to the number of genome types,
rather than the number of cells. The method is implemented in a tool called
Squeezambler. We evaluated Squeezambler on simulated data. The proposed divide
and conquer method successfully reduces the cost of sequencing in comparison
with the naive exhaustive approach.
  Availability: Squeezambler and datasets are available under
http://compbio.cs.wayne.edu/software/squeezambler/.

    <title>The rise and fall of the Phytophthora infestans lineage that triggered
  the Irish potato famine</title>
    <summary>  Phytophthora infestans, the cause of potato late blight, is infamous for
having triggered the Irish Great Famine in the 1840s. Until the late 1970s, P.
infestans diversity outside of its Mexican center of origin was low, and one
scenario held that a single strain, US-1, had dominated the global population
for 150 years; this was later challenged based on DNA analysis of historical
herbarium specimens. We have compared the genomes of 11 herbarium and 15 modern
strains. We conclude that the nineteenth century epidemic was caused by a
unique genotype, HERB-1, that persisted for over 50 years. HERB-1 is distinct
from all examined modern strains, but it is a close relative of US-1, which
replaced it outside of Mexico in the twentieth century. We propose that HERB-1
and US-1 emerged from a metapopulation that was established in the early 1800s
outside of the species' center of diversity.

    <title>Ubiquitous nucleosome unwrapping in the yeast genome</title>
    <summary>  Nucleosome core particle is a dynamic structure -- DNA may transiently peel
off the histone octamer surface due to thermal fluctuations or the action of
chromatin remodeling enzymes. Partial DNA unwrapping enables easier access of
DNA-binding factors to their target sites and thus may provide a dominant
pathway for effecting rapid and robust access to DNA packaged into chromatin.
Indeed, a recent high-resolution map of distances between neighboring
nucleosome dyads in \emph{S.cerevisiae} shows that at least 38.7\% of all
nucleosomes are partially unwrapped. The extent of unwrapping follows a
stereotypical pattern in the vicinity of genes, reminiscent of the canonical
pattern of nucleosome occupancy in which nucleosomes are depleted over
promoters and well-positioned over coding regions. To explain these
observations, we developed a biophysical model which employs a 10-11 base pair
periodic nucleosome energy profile. The profile, based on the pattern of
histone-DNA contacts in nucleosome crystal structures and the idea of linker
length discretization, accounts for both nucleosome unwrapping and higher-order
chromatin structure. Our model reproduces the observed genome-wide distribution
of inter-dyad distances, and accounts for patterns of nucleosome occupancy and
unwrapping around coding regions. At the same time, our approach explains
\emph{in vitro} measurements of accessibility of nucleosome-covered binding
sites, and of nucleosome-induced cooperativity between DNA-binding factors. We
are able to rule out several alternative scenarios of nucleosome unwrapping as
inconsistent with the genomic data.

    <summary>  Protein Fragment Motif Finder (PFMFind) is a system that enables efficient
discovery of relationships between short fragments of protein sequences using
similarity search. It supports queries based on score matrices and PSSMs
obtained through an iterative procedure similar to PSI-BLAST. PSSM construction
is customisable through plugins written in Python. PFMFind consists of a GUI
client, an algorithm using an index for fast similarity search and a relational
database for storing search results and sequence annotations. It is written
mostly in Python. All components communicate between themselves using TCP/IP
sockets and can be located on different physical machines.

    <title>The Karyotype Ontology: a computational representation for human
  cytogenetic patterns</title>
    <summary>  The karyotype ontology describes the human chromosome complement as
determined cytogenetically, and is designed as an initial step toward the goal
of replacing the current system which is based on semantically meaningful
strings. This ontology uses a novel, semi-programmatic methodology based around
the tawny library to construct many classes rapidly. Here, we describe our use

    <title>Fighting against uncertainty: An essential issue in bioinformatics</title>
    <summary>  Many bioinformatics problems, such as sequence alignment, gene prediction,
phylogenetic tree estimation and RNA secondary structure prediction, are often
affected by the "uncertainty" of a solution; that is, the probability of the
solution is extremely small. This situation arises for estimation problems on
high-dimensional discrete spaces in which the number of possible discrete
solutions is immense. In the analysis of biological data or the development of
prediction algorithms, this uncertainty should be handled carefully and
appropriately. In this review, I will explain several methods to combat this
uncertainty, presenting a number of examples in bioinformatics. The methods
include (i) avoiding point estimation, (ii) maximum expected accuracy (MEA)
estimations, and (iii) several strategies to design a pipeline involving
several prediction methods. I believe that the basic concepts and ideas
described in this review will be generally useful for estimation problems in
various areas of bioinformatics.

    <title>SARS-CoV originated from bats in 1998 and may still exist in humans</title>
    <summary>  SARS-CoV is believed to originate from civets and was thought to have been
eliminated as a threat after the 2003 outbreak. Here, we show that human
SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a
cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since
then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype
T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C
but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and
could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter
might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize
civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between
humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump
from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and
2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate
with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong.
Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested
from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly
virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans. These existing but undetected
SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when
favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the
reemergence of SARS.

    <title>YHap: software for probabilistic assignment of Y haplogroups from
  population re-sequencing data</title>
    <summary>  Y haplogroup analyses are an important component of genealogical
reconstruction, population genetic analyses, medical genetics and forensics.
These fields are increasingly moving towards use of low-coverage, high
throughput sequencing. However, there is as yet no software available for using
sequence data to assign Y haplogroup groups probabilistically, such that the
posterior probability of assignment fully reflects the information present in
the data, and borrows information across all samples sequenced from a
population. YHap addresses this problem.

    <title>Role of HIV RNA structure in recombination and speciation: romping in
  purine A, keeps HTLV away</title>
    <summary>  Extreme enrichment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) RNA genome for
the purine A parallels the mild purine-loading of the RNAs of most organisms.
This should militate against loop-loop "kissing" interactions between the
structured viral genome and structured host RNAs, which can generate segments
of double-stranded RNA sufficient to trigger intracellular alarms. However,
human T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1), with the potential to invade the same
host cell, shows extreme enrichment for the pyrimidine C. Assuming the low GC%
HIV and the high GC% HTLV-1 to share a common ancestor, it was postulated that
differences in GC% arose to prevent homologous recombination between these
emerging lentiviral species. Sympatrically isolated by this intracellular
reproductive barrier, prototypic HIV-1 seized the AU-rich (low GC%) high ground
(thus committing to purine A rather than purine G). Prototypic HTLV-1 forwent
this advantage and evolved an independent evolutionary strategy. Evidence
supporting this hypothesis since its elaboration in the 1990s is growing. The
conflict between the needs to encode accurately both a protein, and nucleic
acid structure, is often resolved in favour of the nucleic acid because, apart
from regulatory roles, structure is critical for recombination. However, above
a sequence difference threshold, structure (and hence recombination) is
impaired. New species can then arise.

    <title>VTCdb: A transcriptomics &amp; co-expression database for the crop species
  Vitis vinifera (grapevine)</title>
    <summary>  Gene co-expression databases in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice
have been extensively developed and utilised for predicting gene function and
identifying functional modules for underlying biological processes. However,
such tools are less available for non-model plants such as grapevine. We have
constructed a gene co-expression database, VTCdb
(http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx) that offers an online platform for
transcriptional regulatory inference in the cultivated grapevine. Using a
condition-independent approach, the grapevine co-expression network was
constructed using 352 publicly available microarray datasets from a diverse
experimental series, profiling approximately 9000 genes (40% of the predicted
grapevine transcriptome). Using correlation rank transformation and
graph-clustering, we have identified modules putatively involved in several
fundamental biological processes such as photosynthesis, secondary metabolism
and stress responses. Inter-module network connections revealed a higher-level
organization of function, in which densely connected modules often participated
in related biological processes and had similar expression profiles in
grapevine. The database enables users to query genes, modules or biological
processes of interest. Querying a gene will give a ranked list of co-expressed
genes, functional annotations and information on the associated module.
Alternatively, browsing modules of interest will retrieve information regarding
Gene Ontology and Mapman enriched terms, as well as tissue- and
condition-specific patterns of gene expression within the module. Furthermore,
the database features interactive network visualisation via CytoscapeWeb. VTCdb
should aid researchers in their prioritization of gene candidates for further
study towards the understanding of biological processes related to many aspects
of grapevine development and metabolism.

    <title>Turtle: Identifying frequent k-mers with cache-efficient algorithms</title>
    <summary>  Counting the frequencies of k-mers in read libraries is often a first step in
the analysis of high-throughput sequencing experiments. Infrequent k-mers are
assumed to be a result of sequencing errors. The frequent k-mers constitute a
reduced but error-free representation of the experiment, which can inform read
error correction or serve as the input to de novo assembly methods. Ideally,
the memory requirement for counting should be linear in the number of frequent
k-mers and not in the, typically much larger, total number of k-mers in the
read library.
  We present a novel method that balances time, space and accuracy requirements
to efficiently extract frequent k-mers even for high coverage libraries and
large genomes such as human. Our method is designed to minimize cache-misses in
a cache-efficient manner by using a Pattern-blocked Bloom filter to remove
infrequent k-mers from consideration in combination with a novel
sort-and-compact scheme, instead of a Hash, for the actual counting. While this
increases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the
empirical running times. A variant can resort to a counting Bloom filter for
even larger savings in memory at the expense of false negatives in addition to
the false positives common to all Bloom filter based approaches. A comparison
to the state-of-the-art shows reduced memory requirements and running times.
Note that we also provide the first competitive method to count k-mers up to
size 64.

    <title>Response to No gene-specific optimization of mutation rate in
  Escherichia coli</title>
    <summary>  In a letter published in Molecular Biology Evolution [10], Chen and Zhang
argue that the variation of the mutation rate along the Escherichia coli genome
that we recently reported [3] cannot be evolutionarily optimised. To support
this claim they first attempt to calculate the selective advantage of a local
reduction in the mutation rate and conclude that it is not strong enough to be
favoured by selection. Second, they analyse the distribution of 166 mutations
from a wild-type E. coli K12 MG1655 strain and 1,346 mutations from a
repair-deficient strain, and claim to find a positive association between
transcription and mutation rate rather than the negative association that we
reported. Here we respond to this communication. Briefly, we explain how the
long-standing theory of mutation-modifier alleles supports the evolution of
local mutation rates within a genome by mechanisms acting on sufficiently large
regions of a genome, which is consistent with our original observations [3,4].
We then explain why caution must be exercised when comparing mutations from
repair deficient strains to data from wild-type strains, as different
mutational processes dominate these conditions. Finally, a reanalysis of the
data used by Zhang and Chen with an alternative expression dataset reveals that
their conclussions are unreliable.

    <title>KRAS mutation testing in colorectal cancer as an example of the
  pathologist's role in personalized targeted therapy: a practical approach</title>
    <summary>  Identifying targets for personalized targeted therapy is the pathologist's
domain and a treasure. For decades, pathologists have had to learn, understand,
adopt and implement many new laboratory techniques as they arrived on the
scene. Pathologists successfully integrate the results of those tests into
final pathology reports that were, and still are, the basis of clinical
therapeutic decisions. The molecular methods are different but no more
difficult to comprehend in the era of "kit procedures". Pathologists have the
knowledge and expertise to identify particular gene mutations using the
appropriate molecular tests currently available. This review focuses on the
most important recent developments in KRAS mutation testing in metastatic
colorectal cancer (CRC), and shows that a pathologist is involved in 10 stages
of this procedure. Recent studies have shown that highly sensitive, simple,
reliable and rapid assays may significantly improve the identification of CRC
patients resistant to anti-EGFR therapy. Thus, direct sequencing does not seem
to be an optimal procedure of KRAS testing for clinical purposes. Twelve
currently available high-sensitivity diagnostic assays (with the CE-IVD mark)
for KRAS mutation testing are briefly described and compared. The suggested
pathology report content for somatic mutation tests is described. In
conclusion, evidence is presented that sending away paraffin blocks with tumor
tissue for KRAS mutation testing may not be in the best interest of patients.
Instead, an evidence-based approach indicates that KRAS mutation testing should
be performed in pathology departments, only with the use of CE-IVD/FDA-approved
KRAS tests, and with the obligatory, periodic participation in the KRAS EQA
scheme organized by the European Society of Pathology as an independent
international body.

    <title>Annotation Enrichment Analysis: An Alternative Method for Evaluating the
  Functional Properties of Gene Sets</title>
    <summary>  Gene annotation databases (compendiums maintained by the scientific community
that describe the biological functions performed by individual genes) are
commonly used to evaluate the functional properties of experimentally derived
gene sets. Overlap statistics, such as Fisher's Exact Test (FET), are often
employed to assess these associations, but don't account for non-uniformity in
the number of genes annotated to individual functions or the number of
functions associated with individual genes. We find FET is strongly biased
toward over-estimating overlap significance if a gene set has an unusually high
number of annotations. To correct for these biases, we develop Annotation
Enrichment Analysis (AEA), which properly accounts for the non-uniformity of
annotations. We show that AEA is able to identify biologically meaningful
functional enrichments that are obscured by numerous false-positive enrichment
scores in FET, and we therefore suggest it be used to more accurately assess
the biological properties of gene sets.

    <title>Lightweight LCP Construction for Next-Generation Sequencing Datasets</title>
    <summary>  The advent of "next-generation" DNA sequencing (NGS) technologies has meant
that collections of hundreds of millions of DNA sequences are now commonplace
in bioinformatics. Knowing the longest common prefix array (LCP) of such a
collection would facilitate the rapid computation of maximal exact matches,
shortest unique substrings and shortest absent words. CPU-efficient algorithms
for computing the LCP of a string have been described in the literature, but
require the presence in RAM of large data structures. This prevents such
methods from being feasible for NGS datasets.
  In this paper we propose the first lightweight method that simultaneously
computes, via sequential scans, the LCP and BWT of very large collections of
sequences. Computational results on collections as large as 800 million
100-mers demonstrate that our algorithm scales to the vast sequence collections
encountered in human whole genome sequencing experiments.

    <title>Adaptive reference-free compression of sequence quality scores</title>
    <summary>  Motivation:
  Rapid technological progress in DNA sequencing has stimulated interest in
compressing the vast datasets that are now routinely produced. Relatively
little attention has been paid to compressing the quality scores that are
assigned to each sequence, even though these scores may be harder to compress
than the sequences themselves. By aggregating a set of reads into a compressed
index, we find that the majority of bases can be predicted from the sequence of
bases that are adjacent to them and hence are likely to be less informative for
variant calling or other applications. The quality scores for such bases are
aggressively compressed, leaving a relatively small number at full resolution.
Since our approach relies directly on redundancy present in the reads, it does
not need a reference sequence and is therefore applicable to data from
metagenomics and de novo experiments as well as to resequencing data.
  Results:
  We show that a conservative smoothing strategy affecting 75% of the quality
scores above Q2 leads to an overall quality score compression of 1 bit per
value with a negligible effect on variant calling. A compression of 0.68 bit
per quality value is achieved using a more aggressive smoothing strategy, again
with a very small effect on variant calling.

    <title>Statistical testing of shared genetic control for potentially related
  traits</title>
    <summary>  Integration of data from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
association studies of different traits should allow researchers to disentangle
the genetics of potentially related traits within individually associated
regions. Formal statistical colocalisation testing of individual regions, which
requires selection of a set of SNPs summarizing the association in a region. We
show that the SNP selection method greatly affects type 1 error rates, with
published studies having used methods expected to result in substantially
inflated type 1 error rates. We show that either avoiding variable selection
and instead testing the most informative principal components or integrating
over variable selection using Bayesian model averaging can lead to correct
control of type 1 error rates. Application to data from Graves' disease and
Hashimoto's thyroiditis reveals a common genetic signature across seven regions
shared between the diseases, and indicates that in five of six regions
associated with Graves' disease and not Hashimoto's thyroiditis, this more
likely reflects genuine absence of association with the latter rather than lack
of power. Our examination, by simulation, of the performance of colocalisation
tests and associated software will foster more widespread adoption of formal
colocalisation testing. Given the increasing availability of large expression
and genetic association data sets from disease-relevant tissue and purified
cell populations, coupled with identification of regulatory sequences by
projects such as ENCODE, colocalisation analysis has the potential to reveal
both shared genetic signatures of related traits and causal disease genes and
tissues.

    <title>SSW Library: An SIMD Smith-Waterman C/C++ Library for Use in Genomic
  Applications</title>
    <summary>  Summary: The Smith Waterman (SW) algorithm, which produces the optimal
pairwise alignment between two sequences, is frequently used as a key component
of fast heuristic read mapping and variation detection tools, but current
implementations are either designed as monolithic protein database searching
tools or are embedded into other tools. To facilitate easy integration of the
fast Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) SW algorithm into third party
software, we wrote a C/C++ library, which extends Farrars Striped SW (SSW) to
return alignment information in addition to the optimal SW score. Availability:
SSW is available both as a C/C++ software library, as well as a stand alone
alignment tool wrapping the librarys functionality at

    <title>Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based
  on Polymorphism and Divergence</title>
    <summary>  Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural
selection, but extracting this information for short, widely scattered
noncoding elements remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a new
computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural
Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT
uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and
divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites,
pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for
variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method
is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and
positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism
and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup
genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to
genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure
into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are
estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT
can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex
demographic scenarios. We apply our methods to noncoding RNAs, promoter
regions, and transcription factor binding sites in the human genome, and find
clear evidence of natural selection. We also present a detailed analysis of
particular nucleotide positions within GATA2 binding sites and primary
micro-RNA transcripts.

    <title>SW# - GPU enabled exact alignments on genome scale</title>
    <summary>  Sequence alignment is one of the oldest and the most famous problems in
bioinformatics. Even after 45 years, for one reason or another, this problem is
still actual; current solutions are trade-offs between execution time, memory
consumption and accuracy. We purpose SW#, a new CUDA GPU enabled and memory
efficient implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for local alignment.
In this implementation indels are treated using the affine gap model. Although
there are other GPU implementations of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, SW# is the
only publicly available implementation that can produce sequence alignments on
genome-wide scale. For long sequences, our implementation is at least a few
hundred times faster than a CPU version of the same algorithm.

    <title>Informed and Automated k-Mer Size Selection for Genome Assembly</title>
    <summary>  Genome assembly tools based on the de Bruijn graph framework rely on a
parameter k, which represents a trade-off between several competing effects
that are difficult to quantify. There is currently a lack of tools that would
automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of
k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.
  We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate
abundance histograms with a several orders of magnitude performance improvement
over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the
generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best
possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse
sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best
assemblies.

    <title>Comparing DNA sequence collections by direct comparison of compressed
  text indexes</title>
    <summary>  Popular sequence alignment tools such as BWA convert a reference genome to an
indexing data structure based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), from
which matches to individual query sequences can be rapidly determined. However
the utility of also indexing the query sequences themselves remains relatively
unexplored.
  Here we show that an all-against-all comparison of two sequence collections
can be computed from the BWT of each collection with the BWTs held entirely in
external memory, i.e. on disk and not in RAM. As an application of this
technique, we show that BWTs of transcriptomic and genomic reads can be
compared to obtain reference-free predictions of splice junctions that have
high overlap with results from more standard reference-based methods.
  Code to construct and compare the BWT of large genomic data sets is available
at http://beetl.github.com/BEETL/ as part of the BEETL library.

    <title>GEMINI: integrative exploration of genetic variation and genome
  annotations</title>
    <summary>  Modern DNA sequencing technologies enable geneticists to rapidly identify
genetic variation among many human genomes. However, isolating the minority of
variants underlying disease remains an important, yet formidable challenge for
medical genetics. We have developed GEMINI (GEnome MINIng), a flexible software
package for exploring all forms of human genetic variation. Unlike existing
tools, GEMINI integrates genetic variation with a diverse and flexible set of
genome annotations (e.g., dbSNP, ENCODE, UCSC, ClinVar, KEGG) into a unified
database to facilitate interpretation and data exploration. Whereas other
methods provide an inflexible set of variant filters or variant prioritization
methods, GEMINI allows researchers to compose complex queries based on sample
genotypes, inheritance patterns, and both pre-installed and custom genome
annotations. GEMINI also provides methods for ad hoc queries and data
exploration, a simple programming interface for custom analyses that leverage
the underlying database, and both command line and graphical tools for common
analyses. We demonstrate the utility of GEMINI for exploring variation in
personal genomes and family based genetic studies, and illustrate its ability
to scale to studies involving thousands of human samples. GEMINI is designed
for reproducibility and flexibility and our goal is to will provide researchers
with a standard framework for medical genomics.

    <title>High-speed and accurate color-space short-read alignment with CUSHAW2</title>
    <summary>  Summary: We present an extension of CUSHAW2 for fast and accurate alignments
of SOLiD color-space short-reads. Our extension introduces a double-seeding
approach to improve mapping sensitivity, by combining maximal exact match seeds
and variable-length seeds derived from local alignments. We have compared the
performance of CUSHAW2 to SHRiMP2 and BFAST by aligning both simulated and real
color-space mate-paired reads to the human genome. The results show that
CUSHAW2 achieves comparable or better alignment quality compared to SHRiMP2 and
BFAST at an order-of-magnitude faster speed and significantly smaller peak
resident memory size. Availability: CUSHAW2 and all simulated datasets are

overlapped by downstream analysis. The advantages in read length and accuracy
provided by overlapping paired-end reads demonstrates the necessity for
software to efficiently solve this problem.
  Results: XORRO is an extremely efficient paired-end read overlapping program.
XORRO can overlap millions of short paired-end reads in a few minutes. It uses
64-bit registers with a two bit alphabet to represent sequences and does
comparisons using low-level logical operations like XOR, AND, bitshifting and
popcount.
  Conclusions: As of the writing of this manuscript, XORRO provides the fastest
solution to the paired-end read overlap problem. XORRO is available for

    <title>The MIp Toolset: an efficient algorithm for calculating Mutual
  Information in protein alignments</title>
    <summary>  Background: Coevolution within a protein family is often predicted using
statistics that measure the degree of covariation between positions in the
protein sequence. Mutual Information is a measure of dependence between two
random variables that has been used extensively to predict intra-protein
coevolution.
  Results: Here we provide an algorithm for the efficient calculation of Mutual
Information within a protein family. The algorithm uses linked lists which are
directly accessed by a pointer array. The linked list allows efficient storage
of sparse count data caused by protein conservation. The direct access array of
pointers prevents the linked list from being traversed each time it is
modified.
  Conclusions: This algorithm is implemented in the software MIpToolset, but
could also be easily implemented in other Mutual Information based standalone
software or web servers. The current implementation in the MIpToolset has been
critical in large-scale protein family analysis and real-time coevolution
calculations during alignment editing and curation.
  The MIpToolset is available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/miptoolset/

    <title>Identifying cancer subtypes in glioblastoma by combining genomic,
  transcriptomic and epigenomic data</title>
    <summary>  We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for disease subtype discovery in
multi-dimensional cancer data. Our method can simultaneously analyse a wide
range of data types, allowing for both agreement and disagreement between their
underlying clustering structure. It includes feature selection and infers the
most likely number of disease subtypes, given the data.
  We apply the method to 277 glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas,
for which there are gene expression, copy number variation, methylation and
microRNA data. We identify 8 distinct consensus subtypes and study their
prognostic value for death, new tumour events, progression and recurrence. The
consensus subtypes are prognostic of tumour recurrence (log-rank p-value of
$3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ after correction for multiple hypothesis tests). This is
driven principally by the methylation data (log-rank p-value of $2.0 \times
10^{-3}$) but the effect is strengthened by the other 3 data types,
demonstrating the value of integrating multiple data types.
  Of particular note is a subtype of 47 patients characterised by very low
levels of methylation. This subtype has very low rates of tumour recurrence and
no new events in 10 years of follow up. We also identify a small gene
expression subtype of 6 patients that shows particularly poor survival
outcomes. Additionally, we note a consensus subtype that showly a highly
distinctive data signature and suggest that it is therefore a biologically
distinct subtype of glioblastoma.

    <title>Identification of significant features in DNA microarray data</title>
    <summary>  DNA microarrays are a relatively new technology that can simultaneously
measure the expression level of thousands of genes. They have become an
important tool for a wide variety of biological experiments. One of the most
common goals of DNA microarray experiments is to identify genes associated with
biological processes of interest. Conventional statistical tests often produce
poor results when applied to microarray data due to small sample sizes, noisy
data, and correlation among the expression levels of the genes. Thus, novel
statistical methods are needed to identify significant genes in DNA microarray
experiments. This article discusses the challenges inherent in DNA microarray
analysis and describes a series of statistical techniques that can be used to
overcome these challenges. The problem of multiple hypothesis testing and its
relation to microarray studies is also considered, along with several possible
solutions.

    <title>Optimal DNA shotgun sequencing: Noisy reads are as good as noiseless
  reads</title>
    <summary>  We establish the fundamental limits of DNA shotgun sequencing under noisy
reads. We show a surprising result: for the i.i.d. DNA model, noisy reads are
as good as noiseless reads, provided that the noise level is below a certain
threshold which can be surprisingly high. As an example, for a uniformly
distributed DNA sequence and a symmetric substitution noisy read channel, the
threshold is as high as 19%.

    <title>Origins and evolutionary genomics of the novel 2013 avian-origin H7N9
  influenza A virus in China: Early findings</title>
    <summary>  In March and early April 2013, a new avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus
(A-OIV) emerged in the eastern China. During the first week of April, the 18
infection cases have been confirmed and 6 people have died since March. This
virus has caused global concern as a potential pandemic threat. Here we use
evolutionary analysis to reconstruct the origins and early development of the
A-OIV viruses. We found that A-OIV was derived from a reassortment of three
avian flu virus strains, and substantial mutations have been detected. Our
results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in birds,
and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in avian can
result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.

    <title>Algorithms for Large-scale Whole Genome Association Analysis</title>
    <summary>  In order to associate complex traits with genetic polymorphisms, genome-wide
association studies process huge datasets involving tens of thousands of
individuals genotyped for millions of polymorphisms. When handling these
datasets, which exceed the main memory of contemporary computers, one faces two
distinct challenges: 1) Millions of polymorphisms come at the cost of hundreds
of Gigabytes of genotype data, which can only be kept in secondary storage; 2)
the relatedness of the test population is represented by a covariance matrix,
which, for large populations, can only fit in the combined main memory of a
distributed architecture. In this paper, we present solutions for both
challenges: The genotype data is streamed from and to secondary storage using a
double buffering technique, while the covariance matrix is kept across the main
memory of a distributed memory system. We show that these methods sustain
high-performance and allow the analysis of enormous dataset

    <title>A powerful and efficient set test for genetic markers that handles
  confounders</title>
    <summary>  Approaches for testing sets of variants, such as a set of rare or common
variants within a gene or pathway, for association with complex traits are
important. In particular, set tests allow for aggregation of weak signal within
a set, can capture interplay among variants, and reduce the burden of multiple
hypothesis testing. Until now, these approaches did not address confounding by
family relatedness and population structure, a problem that is becoming more
important as larger data sets are used to increase power.
  Results: We introduce a new approach for set tests that handles confounders.
Our model is based on the linear mixed model and uses two random effects-one to
capture the set association signal and one to capture confounders. We also
introduce a computational speedup for two-random-effects models that makes this
approach feasible even for extremely large cohorts. Using this model with both
the likelihood ratio test and score test, we find that the former yields more
power while controlling type I error. Application of our approach to richly
structured GAW14 data demonstrates that our method successfully corrects for
population structure and family relatedness, while application of our method to
a 15,000 individual Crohn's disease case-control cohort demonstrates that it
additionally recovers genes not recoverable by univariate analysis.
  Availability: A Python-based library implementing our approach is available

    <title>Genome wide identification of regulatory networks associated with
  general cognitive ability using a normalized alignment free similarity
  measure of promoter regions</title>
    <summary>  We show that a normalized alignment free similarity measure, called D2z, can
be used to detect potential regulatory relations for gene sets when little is
known about the regulatory elements involved. One scenario where such gene sets
arise is genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this work we consider a
gene set from a GWAS on childhood general cognitive ability. We build a
co-regulation network for the GWAS genes based on the D2z scores, which shows
potential co-regulatory relationships between the genes as well as predict
additional genes that are likely to be part of the network. We found that the
set of the predicted genes is enriched in genes associated with mental
retardation and GO terms such as synapse and neuron development. In particular,
we found strong evidence of regulatory connection between the GWAS genes and
CHL1, a gene known to be involved in mental retardation.

    <title>Biases in the Experimental Annotations of Protein Function and their
  Effect on Our Understanding of Protein Function Space</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing functional annotation of proteins relies upon the work of
curators to capture experimental findings from scientific literature and apply
them to protein sequence and structure data. However, with the increasing use
of high-throughput experimental assays, a small number of experimental studies
dominate the functional protein annotations collected in databases. Here we
investigate just how prevalent is the "few articles -- many proteins"
phenomenon. We examine the experimentally validated annotation of proteins
provided by several groups in the GO Consortium, and show that the distribution
of proteins per published study is exponential, with 0.14% of articles
providing the source of annotations for 25% of the proteins in the UniProt-GOA
compilation. Since each of the dominant articles describes the use of an assay
that can find only one function or a small group of functions, this leads to
substantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins.
Mass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput
experiments. Consequently, the functional information derived from these
experiments is mostly of the subcellular location of proteins, and of the
participation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some
organisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large
amount. We also show that the information provided by high throughput
experiments is less specific than those provided by low throughput experiments.
Given the experimental techniques available, certain biases in protein function
annotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable. Knowing that
these biases exist and understanding their characteristics and extent is
important for database curators, developers of function annotation programs,
and anyone who uses protein function annotation data to plan experiments.
